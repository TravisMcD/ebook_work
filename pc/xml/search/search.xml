Introduction 
Molecules are constantly in motion due to the kinetic energy present in every atom. This energy results in the net movement of molecules from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration, a process called diffusion.  If uninhibited, this net movement will continue until equilibrium is reached and the mole-cules are uniformly distributed. Once equilibrium is achieved, molecules will continue to move in each direc-tion at an equal rate.  A solution contains two or more substances (solutes) that have been dissolved by a solvent. In the context of a cell, the intracellular and extracellular fluids are the solvents which contain dissolved material (solutes). The rate of diffusion depends on membrane characteristics, size of the solute, and molecular polarity. Because the medi-um will not change in a biological system, the diffusion rate is usually dictated by molecular characteristics of the solute. Small, non-polar molecules exhibit a higher rate of diffusion than large, charged ones.  The direction  of diffusion depends on concentration gradi-ents, heat, and pressure. The concentration gradient is the change of molecular density over a given area (density is de-fined as unit mass per volume of space). Temperature and pressure typically remain constant in biological systems, mak-ing the concentration gradient the best indicator of directional-ity. In general, molecules will move towards areas of lower concentration.

Diffusion and Osmosis 
 Molarity  (moles/liter) is a way to express concentration. It is the number of moles of solute dissolved in one liter of solution, and is commonly represented by 'M'. A mole equals 6.02 x 10
23
 molecules or atoms. Molecu-
lar weight (MW) is the weight of one mole of a chemical and is based off the atomic mass of each atom in the chemical formula. Once the molecular weight of a chemical is known, the weight of chemical to dissolve in a solvent for a specific molar solution can easily be calculated.   A major determinant of diffusion within a biological system is membrane permeability. Cells, as well as some organelles within the cell, are surrounded by selective and differentially permeable membranes. These membranes control the interaction of the cell and its surrounding environment. Acting as a living gatekeeper, the membrane allows, slows, or denies access into the cell.  
  
Cellular membranes are composed of two layers of phospholipids which have hydrophobic fatty acid tails and hydrophilic heads. This lipid bilayer selects for molecules that can dissolve into the lipid environment and against those that cannot. The ability of a molecule to cross the membrane is also determined by its size and electrical charge. Small, uncharged molecules often pass through the membrane easily, while most large or charged molecules are prevented from passing. Molecules which cannot diffuse across the membrane may be able to cross through other regulated gateways located within the membrane.   
http://cartridges.esciencelabs.com/VirtualLearning/ap1903.swf
Dialysis 
Dialysis  is the separation of molecules through diffusion. In dialysis, a differentially permeable membrane is used to separate the components of a mixed solution containing more than one type of molecule. This mem-brane allows the free passage of water, but limits the movement of mole-cules by their size. In one of the following experiments, you will dialyze a solution of glucose and starch to observe membrane permeability.  The concentration of a solution may also impact the membrane permea-bility. A solution or its components may not be able to pass through a membrane if the concentration is too high. For this reason, serial dilutions may be performed to create solutions of lower concentrations. The original sample is a known volume and concentration. A small volume of this sam-ple is transferred sequentially among new tubes, called dilution blanks. The sample is mixed with water (or another diluent) throughout the pro-cess to create more dilute solutions (Figure 2).

Hemodialysis is a method of re-moving toxic substances from the blood when the kidneys are unable to do so. It is frequently used for patients with kidney fail-ure, but may also be used to quickly remove drugs or poisons in dangerous situations.

Diffusion and Osmosis 
Osmosis
 
Osmosis  is similar to diffusion, but refers directly to the movement of <u>water</u> molecules across a selectively permeable membrane, rather than any molecule. This often occurs across the plasma membrane of a cell. Osmosis is directed from an area of high water concentration to an area of low water concentration. Ulti-mately, membrane selectivity and the movement of water in and out of the cell regulate the concentration of intracellular material. As solute concentration increases, solvent concentration decreases. In order to achieve equilibrium, the solvent from a low solute concentration solution will move into an area of high solute concentration to create an equal ratio of solvent to solute in both areas. Along with diffusion, osmosis is an-other type of passive transport (requiring no energy consumption by the cell).  
http://cartridges.esciencelabs.com/VirtualLearning/ap11003.swf
Solution Tonicity 
Tonicity  is a relative term that describes the solute difference between solutions and determines the net di-rection of movement of water molecules (osmosis). There are three types of tonicity: 
 <u>Hypertonic:</u> A solution with a higher solute concentration than the solute concentration on the oppo-site side of the permeable membrane. <u>Hypotonic</u>: A solution with a lower solute concentration  than the solute concentration (i.e., a solution with a higher percentage of water than solute) on the opposite side of the permeable membrane.  <u>Isotonic</u>: A solution with equal solute concentrations on both sides of the permeable membrane (Figure 3).

Diffusion and Osmosis 
Water Potential 
In osmosis, water flows from hypotonic solutions to hypertonic solutions, until they become isotonic. This un-derscores the concept of water potential. Biologists use this term to describe the tendency of water to leave one place in favor of another. Water always moves from an area of higher water potential to an area of lower water potential. The more negative the water potential, the higher the concentration of solutes in the system.   In most biological systems, cells are hypertonic and extracellular water flows into them. If placed in pure wa-ter, they will burst (lyse) as a result of the increased pressure on the membrane from the additional water that diffused into the cell.  
Osmotic Pressure 
Osmotic pressure (the force required to <u>prevent</u> osmosis), also called pressure potential, is the tendency of a solution to gain water across an ideal, partially permeable membrane. It directly correlates with tonicity (higher tonicity causes an increase in osmotic pressure). Some cells, such as plant cells, have specialized structures that regulate osmotic pressure and prevent lysis. This pressure, as well as solute concentration, can affect the water potential (high osmotic pressure = low water potential). This relationship is demonstrated by the following formula:  
&#968; = &#968;
p 
+ &#968;
s 
 
In this equation, &#968; represents water potential, &#968;
p 
is pressure potential, and &#968;
s
 is the solute potential. 
http://cartridges.esciencelabs.com/Osmotic-Pressure.swf
 Both diffusion and osmosis are imperative to cell survival. They enable cells to maintain equilibrium of solute concentrations across two sides of a permeable membrane. However, the two processes facilitate solute equilibrium in opposite ways.

Chemical diffusion can create a variety of states for the cell or even an entire organ.

Diffusion and Osmosis 
Aquaporins 
For much of scientific history, the abundance of water molecules throughout the body led many scientists to believe that osmosis alone was a sufficient mechanism for water movement across cellular membranes. However, in 1992 Peter Agre discovered a unique family of proteins, later termed "aquaporins", which were also involved in water transport. Agre won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2003 for this paradigm-changing discovery. You can learn more about Peter Agre and his discovery here: 
<u>http://www.nobelprize.org/</u>
<u>nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2003/agre-autobio.html</u>
 
 Aquaporins are a specific form of integral membrane proteins which span lipid bilayers to facilitate molecular movement. They use a combination of electromagnetic and hydrophilic interactions and spatial selectivity to funnel water molecules from one side of a membrane to another. Aquaporins are most populous in tissues which require high levels of water transport such as the kidney, salivary glands, (lacrimal) tear glands and other epithelial cells. Can you think of a reason why aquaporins are so important in these tissues? Although aquaporins can be ubiquitous in certain locations, the actual aquaporin present may vary by tissue/organ. The most common aquaporin in called aquaporin 1 (AQP1). AQP1 is found in the kidney and forms a homo-tetramer protein across the cellular membranes within this organ. "Homotetramer" means that it is com-posed of four, identical simpler molecules.   
Water molecules are attracted to these pores. However, rather than moving through the central homotetram-er central channel, water molecules move through one of the four individual channels formed by the four monomer subunits. These channels are very tiny, with a diameter of only 3 &#197; (3 &#197;: 1 &#197; = 1 x 10
-10 
m). This 
further increases the specific of aquaporins because many molecules are much larger than this (note: water molecules are only 2.8 &#197;).

Experiment 1: Diffusion through a Liquid
 
In this experiment, you will observe the effect that different molecular weights have on the ability of dye to travel through a viscous medium. 
Procedure
 
1.  Use tape to secure one half (either the bottom or the top half is fine) of the petri dish over a ruler. Make 
sure that you can read the measurement markings on the ruler through the petri dish. The dish should 
be positioned with the open end of the dish facing upwards. 
2.  Carefully fill the half of the petri dish with corn syrup until the entire surface is covered. 
3.  Place a single drop of blue dye in the middle of the corn syrup. Note the position where the dye fell by 
reading the location of the outside edge of the dye on ruler. 
Note: 
The diffusion will take place very quickly! Be prepared to take measurements as soon as the 
dye drops onto the corn syrup.  
4.  Measure the outside edge of the dye (the distance it has traveled) every ten seconds for a total of sixty 
seconds. Record your data in Tables 1 and 2.  
5.  Repeat Steps 1 - 4 using the red dye, the second half of the petri dish, and fresh corn syrup.

Note: 
 
 
Dialysis tubing can be rinsed and used again if you make a mistake.  
 
Dialysis tubing must be soaked in water before you will be able to open it up to create the dialysis "bag". Follow the directions for the experiment, beginning with soaking the tubing in a beaker of water. Then, place the dialysis tubing between your thumb and forefinger and rub the two digits together in a shearing manner. This should open up the &#34;tube&#34; so you can fill it with the different solutions.

Diffusion and Osmosis 
Procedure 
1.  Measure and pour 50 mL of water into a 100 mL beaker. Cut a piece of dialysis tubing 15.0 cm long. Sub-
merge the dialysis tubing in the water for at least 10 minutes.  
2.  Measure and pour 82 mL water into a second 100 mL beaker. This is the beaker you will put the filled dial-
ysis bag into in Step 9. 
3.  While the dialysis bag is still soaking, make the glucose/sucrose mixture. Use a graduated pipette to add 
five mL of glucose solution to a third beaker and label it "Dialysis bag solution". Use a different graduated 
pipette to add five mL of starch solution to the same beaker. Mix by pipetting the solution up and down the 
pipette six times. 
4.  Using the same pipette that you used to mix the dialysis bag solution, remove two mL of that solution and 
place it in a clean beaker.  This sample will serve as your positive control for glucose and starch.   
a.  Dip one of the glucose test strips into the two mL of glucose/starch solution in the third beaker. Af-
ter one minute has passed, record the final color of the glucose test strip in Table 3. This is your 
positive control for glucose. 
b.  Use a pipette to transfer approximately 0.5 mL of IKI to into the two mL of glucose/starch solution 
in the third beaker. After one minute has passed, record the final color of the glucose/starch solu-
tion in the beaker in Table 3. This is your positive control for starch. 
5.  Using a clean pipette, remove two mL of water from the 82 mL of water you placed in a beaker in Step 2 
and place it in a clean beaker. This sample will serve as your negative control for glucose and starch. 
a.  Dip one of the glucose test strips into the two mL of water in the beaker. After one minute has 
passed, record the final color of the glucose test strip in Table 3. This is your negative control for 
glucose. 
b.  Use a pipette to transfer approximately 0.5 mL of IKI to into the two mL of water in the beaker. Af-
ter one minute has passed, record the final color of the water in the beaker in Table 3. This is your 
negative control for starch. 
Note: 
The color results of these controls determine the indicator reagent key. You must use these 
results to interpret the rest of your results.  
6.  After at least 10 minutes have passed, remove the dialysis tubing. Use your thumb and pointer finger to 
rub the tubing between your fingers; this will open the dialysis tubing. Close one end of the tubing by fold-
ing over 3.0 cm of one end (this will become the bottom). Fold it again and secure with a rubber band (use

7.  To test that no solution can leak out, add a few drops of water to the tubing and look for water leakage. If 
any water leaks, tighten the rubber band and/or the knot in the tubing. Make sure you pour the water out 
of the tubing before continuing to the next step. 
8.  Using the same pipette which was used to mix the solution in Step 3, transfer 
eight mL of the solution from the Dialysis Bag Solution beaker to the pre-
pared dialysis bag. 
9.  Place the filled dialysis tube in beaker filled with 80 mL of water with the 
open end draped over the edge of the beaker as shown in Figure 4.  
10. Allow the solution to sit for 60 minutes. Clean and dry all materials except the 
beaker with the dialysis bag. 
11. After the solution has diffused for 60 minutes, remove the dialysis tube from 
the beaker and empty the contents into a clean, dry beaker. Label it dialysis bag solution.   
12. Test the dialysis bag solution for the presence of glucose and starch. Test for the presence of glucose by 
dipping one glucose test strip into the dialysis bag directly. Again, wait one minute before reading the re-
sults of the test strips. Record your results for the presence of glucose and starch in Table 4. Test for the 
presence of starch by adding two mL IKI. Record the final color in Table 4 after one minute has passed.

Diffusion and Osmosis 
Experiment 3: Osmosis - Direction and Concentration Gradients 
In this experiment, we will investigate the effect of solute concentration on osmosis. A semi-permeable mem-brane (dialysis tubing) and sucrose will create an osmotic environment similar to that of a cell. This selective permeability allows us to examine the net movement of water across the membrane. You will begin the ex-periment with a 30% sucrose solution, and perform a set of serial dilutions to create lower concentration so-lutions. Some of the sucrose concentrations will be membrane permeable; while others will not be permea-ble (can you determine why this is?).  
Procedure
 
1.  Use the permanent marker to label the three 250 mL beakers as 1, 2, and 3. 
2.  Cut four strips of dialysis tubing, each 15.0 cm long. Fill Beaker 3 with 100 mL of water and submerge 
the four pieces of dialysis tubing in the water for at least 10 minutes. 
3.  After 10 minutes, remove one piece of tubing from the beaker. Use your thumb and pointer finger to rub 
the tubing between your fingers; this will open the tubing. Close one end of the tubing by folding over 3.0 
cm of one end (this will become the bottom). Fold it again and secure with a yellow rubber band (use  
4.  Tie a knot in the remaining dialysis tubing just above or just below the rubber band. This will create a 
seal and ensures that solution will not leak out of the tube later in the experiment.

ly. Use the graduated cylinder and waste beakers to create these solutions. Set these solutions aside. 
9.  Pour 150 mL of the remaining stock sucrose solution into Beaker 1. 
10. Use some of the remaining stock sucrose solution to create an additional 200 mL of a 3% sucrose solu-
tion into Beaker 2.  
Hint: 
Use your knowledge of serial dilutions to create this final, 3% sucrose solution.  
11. Measure and pour 10 mL of the remaining 30% sucrose solution into the dialysis bag with the yellow 
rubber band. Seal the top of this tubing with the remaining yellow rubber band.  
12. Measure and pour 10 mL of the 15% sucrose solution in the bag with the red rubber band, and seal the 
top of the dialysis tubing with the remaining red rubber band. 10 mL of the 3% sucrose solution in the 
bag with the blue rubber band, and seal the dialysis tubing with the remaining blue rubber band. The

Diffusion and Osmosis 
Experiment 4: Osmosis - Tonicity and the Plant Cell 
Plant cells are able to generate osmotic pressure while other cells cannot. This is due to specialized plant structures such as the cell wall which prevent lysis caused by osmosis. By taking advantage of this system, you will be able to look at the effects of tonicity in a biological system.   
Procedure 
1.  Use the permanent marker to label two test tubes as A, and two test tubes as B. Place the test tubes in 
the test tube rack. 
2.  Identify the two potato types in the first two cells of the first column in Table 7. Then, select one potato to 
test first and record observations about the physical characteristics in Table 7.  
Note: 
Be sure to include observations which acknowledge the texture, color, and any other distin-
guishing factors. 
3.  Use a knife to carefully cut two strips of the potato on a cutting board. These will be referred to as Sam-
ple A and Sample B. The strips should be as close to 10 cm long and one cm wide as possible to ensure 
that the strips fit in the test tubes. 
4.  Fill the 100 mL graduated cylinder with 50 mL of water. Place the first potato strip (Sample A) into the 
graduated cylinder and record the initial displacement in Table 7. 
Note: Displacement is a measurement of change. It is calculated by subtracting the original volume 
(50 mL) from the final volume after the potato is added to the 50 mL of water. For example, 57 mL - 
50 mL = 7 mL of displacement.

9.  Use a pipette to add water to each of the test tubes with the A samples in them until the water covers 
the potato strips.  
10. Refer to the instructions provided on the bottle with 16 g of sodium chloride in it to create a 20% sodium 
chloride solution. Use a pipette to add the 20% sodium chloride solution to each of the test tubes with

Introduction 
http://www.esciencelabs.com/portal/java_content/General Chemistry/Catalysts.jnlp
Enzymes are specialized proteins made by living cells that function as biological catalysts. A catalyst serves to decrease the activation energy normally needed for a reaction to naturally occur. Enzymes can increase the reaction rate between two molecules by over a million times faster than it would occur without the en-zyme. Most biochemical reactions require enzymes for them to occur at fast enough rates to be useful. Typi-cal nomenclature for enzymes uses name of the substrate or the chemical reaction it catalyzes as the prefix, and adds the segment "-ase" as the suffix (e.g., catalase, amylase, polymerase, etc.). Keep in mind that some enzymes, such as pepsin, do not follow this nomenclature.  Enzymes are extremely selective, and are often described as adhering to a "lock and key" fit (Figure 1). Their selectivity is primarily enforced by their molecular shape, hydrophilic interactions, and electrostatic forces. These factors dictate which substrate(s) the enzyme can bind and effect. The activation site is a region on the enzyme where the substrate attaches to form the enzyme/substrate complex. This is also where the reac-tion occurs. After the enzyme-substrate complex forms and catalysis occurs, the modified substrate is re-leased from the active site, and the enzyme can repeat the process. Enzymes levels are not reduced or al-tered during the reaction. This means they are efficient and can be used repeatedly.

Enzyme Catalysis 
Activation Energy 
Molecules harbor energy within their chemical bonds. This energy is released when the bonds are broken, thus defining one of the primary reasons why bonds are broken in biological pathways such as metabolism. However, chemical reactions require an initial amount of energy to break and form bonds (even if the reaction is exothermic). This is often referred to as activation energy as it corresponds to the minimum amount of energy needed to engage (or, activate) a reaction. Enzymes are useful in chemical reactions as they can low-er the activation energy required to initiate the reaction. For example, consider trying to roll a large rock on a flat surface. This can be very difficult to do; however, what if you only had to roll the rock down a hill? This would make the process much easier to accomplish. Enzymes are homologous to the downhill slope by de-creasing the effort it takes to start a chemical reaction.  Activation energy makes molecules unstable. If sufficient activation energy is available, the bonds existing within the now unstable molecule break to create new, more stable molecules. Activation energy separates the energy levels of the substrates and products and by amounts which are sufficient to initiate the transition state (in which the reactants become unstable) so the reaction can occur. Energy must be added to the sub-strates to overcome this barrier, which can be recovered when products are formed.  
Reaction Kinetics 
Enzymes influence the rate at which a chemical reaction occurs. Their activi-ty is affected by three primary factors: 
 
Salt concentration 
 
Temperature 
 
pH 
  Salt concentrations in the enzyme's environment, either too high or too low, can influence the behavior of the charged amino acids that make up the pro-tein structure of the enzyme. When this occurs, normal interaction of the charged groups is blocked and the enzyme is no longer functional.  Temperature increases the rate of chemical reactions in two different ways: increasing or decreasing the reaction rate constant and thermal denaturation. The reaction rate constant can be increased or decreased, and typically ad-heres to a linear relationship to the direction in which the temperature is ad-justed. However, if the temperature rises above an optimum value, enzymes or (their substrates) may become damaged, lose functionality or denature entirely.  The pH can influence the efficiency or potential of an enzyme to perform. In

Did You Know... 
 
Enzymes, including proteases and amylases, started being used in laundry detergents in 1913. At the time, this integra-tion was not economically practical, and the enzymes stained the machines used to process the detergent. How-ever, almost 50% of liquid de-tergents and 25% of pow-dered detergents now incor-porate enzymes to help break down stains which can't be removed with chemical sur-factants alone.

Enzyme Catalysis 
fact, the majority of enzymes can only within a narrow pH range of approximately 5 - 9. Specifically, pH affects reaction kinematics through the following techniques: 
1.  Altering the binding site on the enzyme. 2.  Changing the protein structure of the enzyme itself 3.  Revising the ionization status of the enzyme or substrate.  
 How do you think the functional pH of enzymes in the stomach compares to the optimal pH for enzymes in blood?  The concentrations of both the enzyme and substrate can also influence the reaction rate (Figure 2). The maximum velocity of the reaction is achieved at a saturating concentration of substrate, at which every enzyme molecule is utilized in the reaction. At low substrate concentrations, an enzyme can readily con-vert a substrate into products. However, as more substrate is added, an enzyme will reach a saturation point at which the reaction rate will plateau. This point occurs when there are more substrate molecules than the enzyme can convert in a given period of time. This interaction falls into the category of "saturation kinetics".
 
Figure 2: 
Reaction rate increases with higher substrate concentrations until it meets maximum velocity.

Enzyme Catalysis 
Cofactors: Activators and Inhibitors 
Substances other than the substrate, called enzyme co-factors, can bind to the enzyme and influence its be-havior. Unlike enzymes, cofactors bind to the enzyme and are structurally modified during the chemical reac-tion. These substances include metals such as zinc and copper, as well as organic substances such as Co-enzyme A. Organic cofactors are also referred to as coenzymes. Cofactors are typically activators, increas-ing the activity of an enzyme.  Inhibitors are chemicals that interfere with the binding of the substrate to the enzyme. Many drugs and poi-sons are enzyme inhibitors. For example, aspirin inhibits an enzyme that leads to inflammation. There are two types of inhibitors: 
1.  Competitive: Can be replaced by the substrate. 2.  Non-competitive: Can not removed by the substrate. 
 Competitive inhibitors bind at the active site, therefore, they are competing with the actual substrate for that site. Non-competitive inhibitors bind elsewhere on the enzyme, so there is no competition.  Enzymes are required for normal cellular activity. Standard cellular processes produce toxic substances (waste) such as hydrogen peroxide and free radicals that will kill the cell if they are not eliminated. Fortunate-ly, yeast and other organisms (including humans) have an enzyme called catalase that breaks down hydro-gen peroxide into oxygen and water, which are both harmless to cells. Thus, enzymes are responsible for both constructive (anabolism) and destructive (catabolism) activities that work synergistically to pattern the overall  metabolism of an organism.

Enzyme Catalysis 
Experiment 1: Enzymes in Food
 
Amylase is used by humans to facilitate digestion by breaking down starch molecules into sugar molecules. It is found naturally in human saliva and the pancreas. However, it is also present in some of the common foods consumed by humans. This experiment examines the presence of amylase in food by using Iodine-Potassium Iodide, a color indicator used to detect starch.  
Note: 
Iodine-Potassium Iodide (IKI) turns dark purple in the presence of starch. 
 
Procedure:
 
1.  Remove the cap from the starch solution. Attach the spray lid to the starch solution. 
2.  Rinse out the empty two ounce bottle with tap water. Use the 100 mL graduated cylinder to measure and 
pour 30 mL of IKI into the empty two ounce bottle. Attach the remaining spray lid to the bottle. 
3.  Set up a positive control for this experiment by spraying a paper towel with the starch solution. Allow the 
starch to dry for approximately one hour (this time interval may vary by location). 
4.  In the mean time, set up a negative control for this experiment. Use your knowledge of the scientific meth-
od and experimental controls to establish this component. Describe your negative control in Table 1. 
Hint: 
What should happen when IKI solution contacts something that does not contain starch?  
5.  When the starch solution has dried, test your positive and negative controls. This step establishes a base-
line color scale for you to evaluate the starch concentration of the food products you will test in Steps 7 - 
11. Record your results in Table 1.

er. 
9.  Wash your hands with soap and water.  
10. Take your finger and place it on your tongue to transfer some saliva to your finger. Then, rub your mois-
tened finger saliva into the paper towel. Repeat this step until you are able to adequately moisten the pa-
per towel.

Experiment 2: Effect of Temperature on Enzyme Activity
 
Yeast cells contain catalase, an enzyme which helps convert hydrogen peroxide to water and ox-ygen. This enzyme is very significant as hydrogen peroxide can be toxic to cells if allowed to accu-mulate. The effect of catalase can be seen when yeast is combined with hydrogen peroxide (Catalase: 2 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + O<sub>2</sub> ).
In this experiment, you will examine the effects of temperature on enzyme (catalase) activity based on the amount of oxygen produced. Note, be sure to remain observant for effervescence when ana-lyzing your results.

Enzyme Catalysis 
Procedure 
1.  Use a permanent marker to label test tubes 1, 2, and 3. Place them in the test tube rack.  
2.  Fill each tube with 10 mL hydrogen peroxide. Then, keep one of the test tubes in the test tube rack, but 
transfer the two additional test tubes to two separate 250 mL beakers. 
3.  Find one of the balloons, and the piece of string. Wrap the string around the uninflated balloon and 
measure the length of the string with the ruler. Record the measurement in Table 2. 
4.  Create a hot water bath by performing the following steps: 
a.  Determine if you will use a stovetop or microwave to heat the water. <u>If using a stovetop</u>, obtain a 
small pot and proceed to Step 3. <u>If using a microwave</u>, obtain a microwave-safe bowl and pro-ceed to Step 3e. 
b.  Use the 100 mL graduated cylinder to measure and pour approximately 200 mL of water into a 
small pot or microwave-safe bowl (you will have to measure this volume in two separate alloca-tions). 
c.  If using a stove, place a small pot on the stove and turn the stove on to a medium heat setting. 
d.  Carefully monitor the water in the pot until it comes to a soft boil (approximately 100 &#176;C). Use the 
thermometer provided in your lab kit to verify the water temperature. Turn the stove off when the water begins to boil. Immediately proceed to Step 5. 
CAUTION: 
Be sure to turn the stove off after creating the hot water bath. Monitor the heating wa-
ter at all times, and never handle a hot pan without appropriate pot holders. 
e.  If using a microwave, place the microwave-safe bowl in the microwave and heat the water in 30 
second increments until the temperature of the water is approximately 100 &#176;C. Use the thermom-eter provided in your lab kit to verify the water temperature. Wait approximately one minute be-fore proceeding to Step 5. 
5.  Place Tube 1 in the refrigerator. Leave Tube 2 at room temperature, and place Tube 3 in the hot
 
water 
bath.  
Important Note: 
The water should be at approximately 85 &#176;C when you place Tube 3 in it. Verify the 
temperature with the thermometer to ensure the water is not too hot! Temperatures which exceed 
approximately 85  &#176;C may denature the hydrogen peroxide.  
6.  Record the temperatures of each condition in Table 2. Be sure to provide the thermometer with sufficient 
time in between each environment to avoid obscuring the temperature readings.

7.  Let the tubes sit for 15 minutes. 
8.  After the elapsed time, remove the tubes from the refrigerator and the hot water bath and place all of the 
tubes back in the test tube rack. 
9. Add 
1
/
4
  tsp. of yeast to Tube 1 (the refrigerated test tube).  
10. Quickly attach a balloon to the top of Tube 1. It is important to execute this step quickly so that every bit

Introduction 
Cellular respiration refers to the process of converting chemical energy existing within organic molecules, such as sugars, into a form which can be immediately used by organisms. This process is required for both aerobic (organisms which have oxygen available) and anaerobic (organisms which do not have oxygen avail-able) organisms, but it is executed differently based on the compounds and structures local to the host. How-ever, both processes share the common goal of harvesting biological energy stored in fuel molecules (such as glucose) and convert this energy into ATP.    
ADP and ATP 
Adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, is often referred to as the en-ergy currency of the cell. It is used in the majority of cellular func-tions including active transport across a membrane, cell structure maintenance, DNA and RNA synthesis, protein synthesis, etc. However, even though this molecule is extremely important, sometimes more ATP is required than is available. When ATP levels become too low, a special protein signals the cell to begin respiration. 
 
 
Respiration occurs in anaerobic and aerobic organisms, there-fore, there is more than one pathway used to produce ATP. How-ever, a high level analysis can conclude that in both types of or-ganisms, insufficient concentrations of ATP can trigger a series of metabolic reactions which ultimately replenish the local ATP sup-ply. These reactions are primarily catabolic; in other words, they break down big molecules into smaller pieces. Free energy is released when the molecules are broken down, which can be sequentially used in each proceeding step. Through a series of oxidation reactions, the cell converts carbohydrates into carbon

sists of the nucleotide adenine (green and blue in the model), a 5-sided sugar (ribose; green and pink in the model), and three phosphates (orange), each bound to three oxygen molecules (pink). Cleavage of one phosphate molecule from ATP yields the amount of energy (calories) found in a sin-gle peanut.

Metabolism 
dioxide and water. It also transforms adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into ATP by adding a free phosphate molecule to ADP. This set of reactions provides a constant source of energy for the cell, as long as all the critical components for the reactions are available.   
Glycolysis 
The first stage of respiration is called glycolysis. Glycolysis occurs with or without oxygen and takes place in the cytoplasm. During glycolysis, glucose is broken down to provide energy for the cell. The glycolytic path-way is highly conserved amongst organisms, and is found in all living organisms. The reaction is written as follows: 
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>    +    6 O<sub>2</sub>       6 CO<sub>2</sub>   +   6 H<sub>2</sub>O   +   energy
                (glucose)      (oxygen)   (carbon dioxide)  (water)   
Glucose contains high energy bonds which release electrons (energy) when broken. Through this process, the six-carbon glucose molecule is broken down into two, three-carbon molecules called pyruvic acid (pyruvate). Though the bonds holding pyruvate together contain a great deal of potential energy, this step yields little energy. Only two ATP molecules and two nictotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) molecules are produced during glycolysis. 
 
  
Aerobic Respiration vs. Fermentation 
The next stage of respiration depends on if the organism is aerobic or anaerobic or, in the case of multicellu-lar organisms such as plants, if oxygen is available to the cell. In an aerobic environment, the citric acid cycle begins. Conversely, if an anaerobic environment exists, fermentation or anaerobic respiration takes place. Plants primarily engage in aerobic respiration. However, in rare cases such as extremely wet soil which re-sults in waterlogged roots, anaerobic respiration may also occur in plants. The steps involved in aerobic res-piration, anaerobic respiration, and fermentation vary, but all involve the manipulation of electrons and serve to perpetuate the availability of energy for the cell.  In aerobic respiration, pyruvate molecules are shuttled from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria to prepare for the citric acid cycle. An enzyme complex called pyruvate dehydrogenase complex produces acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) by initially breaking down pyruvate to a two-carbon acetyl group and carbon diox-ide. The acetyl group is then transferred to coenzyme A. Coenzyme A then acts as a carrier for the two-carbon acetyl group and transfers the acetyl group to the citric acid cycle.  
 The Citric 
Acid Cycle
 
The citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), is an eight step process in which the acetyl group is oxidized to carbon dioxide. The citric acid cycle engages both anabolic and catabolic reactions to construct and break down large molecules. During this process, two important electron shuttle molecules [flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD
+
)] 
are reduced forming FADH
2
 and NADH. These molecules shuttle electrons to the next step of aerobic respi-
ration, the electron transport chain.

 145 
Metabolism 
The electron transport chain, ETC, performs the final series of biochemical reactions. Ultimately, the ETC functions to regenerate oxidized molecules (coenzymes) from their reduced state so that other glucose mole-cules can be converted to energy through future rounds of respiration. To accomplish this objective, elec-trons (and hydrogen ions) from FADH<sub>2</sub>
and NADH are transferred to enzyme complexes embedded in the 
mitochondria's inner membrane. These complexes act as electron acceptors, passing the electrons from one complex to the next. In plants and many other organisms, the final electron accepter is oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). It is im-
portant to note that if the electrons released through the citric acid cycle were transferred directly to oxygen, the energy content would be so great that the oxygen molecule would combust. The use of FAD and NAD<sup>+</sup>
 
as electron shuttles circumvents this issue. Energy released through the oxidation of FADH<sub>2</sub>
 and NADH is 
ultimately used to phosphorylate ADP forming ATP. Oxidative phosphorylation describes this complicated process. Since oxygen has a very high affinity for electrons, aerobic respiration is the most efficient means of producing ATP (up to 34 <u>molecules</u>are generated per round).   
Fermentation
 
Eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms use fermentation in anaerobic conditions. In these cases, the citric ac-id cycle and the ETC are not used. Instead, pyruvate is the final substrate. These molecules are metabolized in the cytoplasm to produce alcohol or lactic acid, depending on the organism. The main function of fermen-tation is the reduction of NADH to NAD
+
. This contributes to the propagation of the glycolytic pathway, which 
allows ATP production to continue. Recall that glycolysis nets two ATP molecules per glucose molecule. Fer-mentation allows for the generation of much less ATP per glucose molecule than aerobic respiration because the citric acid cycle and the ETC are not engaged.

Metabolism 
Industrial Applications 
Fermentation has many industrial applications, many of which are evident within the food industry. For example, the sour or tart taste of yogurt and sauerkraut is due to bacteria in the Lactobacillus  genus.  Lactobacillus  perform lactate fermentation in which pyruvic acid (from glycolysis) is reduced directly to the final end product, lactic acid. An-other example of industrial fermentation focuses on yeast. Yeast, a unicellular eukaryote, has been used to make leavened (rising) bread for centuries. When yeast under-goes fermentation, carbon dioxide is trapped between glu-ten and causes the bread to rise. Ethanol is another by-product of fermentation and is responsible for the alcohol content in beer. Carbon dioxide produced through fermen-tation is responsible for the effervescence in beer.  
 
Respirometers 
Scientists may use respirometers to measure the rate of respiration. This device capitalizes on the ideal gas law for its function. The ideal gas law applies to those gases in which all collisions between atoms or mole-cules are perfectly elastic and no intermolecular forces exist. The internal energy is completely kinetic, and any change in energy will be accompanied by a change in temperature, volume, and pressure. The relation-ship is defined by the ideal gas law equation:  
PV = nRT 
 
In this equation, P is the absolute pressure, V is the volume, R is the universal gas constant (8.3145 J/mol &#176;K), and T is the absolute temperature (&#176;Kelvin). Respirometers typically consist of a device to absorb carbon dioxide produced through respiration and measure oxygen uptake by displacement of fluid in a tube con-
? 
Did You Know... 
 
Cells require more energy during physical activity than when the body is at rest. Humans rely on aerobic respiration to provide this energy. However, some physical activities (such as a strenuous workout) may create an anaerobic environment if the oxygen supply depletes before the demand is removed. When this occurs, lactate fermentation will begin to provide additional energy without the use of oxygen. Lactic acid is a 3-carbon molecule. Therefore, most of the energy remains and the only energy produced is the two ATP molecules generated from glycolysis. The buildup of lactic acid can cause muscles to feel sore and stiff. This feeling persists until the lactic acid is removed from the muscles by diffusion into the blood.

undergoes this fermentation.

Procedure 
1.  Use the permanent marker to label three 250 mL beakers as Equal&#174;
, Splenda&#174;
, and Sugar.  
2.  Empty the Equal&#174;
, Splenda&#174;
, and Sugar packets into the corresponding beakers. 
3.  Fill the Equal&#174;
  and Splenda&#174;
 beakers to the 100 mL mark with tap water.  
4.  Fill the Sugar beaker to the 200 mL mark. 
5.  Mix each beaker thoroughly by pipetting the solution up and down. Each beaker now contains a 1% solu-
tion. Set these aside for later use. 
6.  Completely fill the smallest tube with tap water and invert the larger tube over it. Push the small tube up 
(into the larger tube) until the top connects with the bottom of the inverted tube. Invert the respirometer so 
that the larger tube is upright (there should be a small bubble at the top of the internal tube). 
Note: 
Repeat Step 6 several times as practice. Strive for the smallest bubble possible. When you feel 
comfortable with this technique, empty the test tube(s) and proceed to Step 7. 
7.  Use the permanent marker to label the fourth 250 mL beaker as Yeast. 
8.  Fill this beaker with 175 mL of warm tap water. The exact temperature does not matter, but the water 
should be warm to the touch. 
9.  Open the yeast package, and use the measuring spoon to measure and pour 1 tsp. yeast into the beaker. 
Pipette the solution up and down until all of the yeast has dissolved into solution. 
Note: 
Make sure the yeast solution remains homogenous before each test tube is filled in the pro-
ceeding steps. The yeast concentration is fairly saturated, and yeast may precipitate out of solution if 
the beaker rests for an extended period of time.  
10. Use the permanent marker to label the big and small test tubes as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 
11. Use the 100 mL graduated cylinder to measure and pour 15 mL of the following solutions into the corre-
sponding test tubes:  
Tube 1: 1% Glucose Solution  
Tube 2: 1% Sucrose Solution  
Tube 3: 1% Equal&#174;
 Solution 
Tube 4:  1% Splenda&#174;
 Solution 
Tube 5:  1% Sugar Solution  
Note:
 
Rinse the graduated cylinder between each measurement. 
12. Fill the remaining volume in each small tube to the top with the yeast solution. 
13. Slide the corresponding larger tube over the small tube and invert it as practiced in Step 6. This will mix 
the yeast and sugar/sweetener solutions.

Experiment 2: Aerobic Respiration in Beans 
We will evaluate respiration in beans by comparing carbon dioxide production between germinated and non-germinated beans. As shown in the balanced equation for cellular respiration, one of the byproducts is CO<sub>2</sub>
(carbon dioxide): 
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>  +  6 H<sub>2</sub>O   +  6 O<sub>2</sub>    energy  +  6 CO<sub>2</sub>  +  12 H<sub>2</sub>O
  We will use a carbon dioxide indicator ( bromothymol blue) to show oxygen is being consumed and carbon dioxide is being released by the beans. Bromothymol blue is an indicator that turns 
yellow 
in 
acidic 
condi-
tions, 
green
 
in 
neutral 
conditions, and 
blue
 
in 
basic
 
conditions. When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, 
carbonic acid is formed by the reaction: 
H<sub>2</sub>O  +  CO<sub>2</sub>  H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>
  
resulting in the formation of this weak acid. If an indicator such as bromothymol blue is present, what do you think would happen? (Hint - what color would the indicator change to?) 
Procedure 
1.  Label two of the 250 mL beakers as Soaked: Pinto and Soaked: Kidney.  
2.  Fill each beaker with 200 mL water. 
3.  Count and transfer 50 pinto beans into the Soaked: Pinto beaker. Then, count and transfer 50 kidney 
beans into the Soaked: Kidney beaker. Allow the beakers to rest for 24 hours. 
4.  After 24 hours have passed, carefully strain the water from each beaker. 
5.  Place two paper towels on a flat work surface. Use the permanent marker to label one paper towel as 
Soaked: Pinto and the second as Soaked: Kidney. 
6.  Pour the soaked beans onto paper towels, keeping them sorted by bean type. 
7.  Label the remaining beakers as Dry: Pinto, No Pinto, Dry: Kidney, and No Kidney.

Introduction 
Taxonomy is the classification (organization) of organisms into related groups. Very early on, scientists rec-ognized the importance of classifying or ranking organisms. In the 1700s, Carl Linnaeus (also known as Carl von Linn&#233; or Carolus Linnaeus) developed what is now known as the Linnaean Classification System. At the highest level in this system, everything in nature was divided into three kingdoms: mineral, vegetable, and animal. Linnaeus then ranked sequentially smaller groups within each kingdom as class, order, genus, species and variety. This contribution to science earned him the title "The Father of Taxonomy". His system is still, in an evolved form, used today.   
Linnaean Classification 
Starting with domain, there is a continual increase in specifici-ty as organisms are classified into smaller and smaller cate-gories (Figure 1). In other words, the categories get smaller in terms of the number of organisms that are included. As illus-trated in Figure 1, the Linnaean system classifies organisms into sequential groups:

Safety Information 
Performing the Experiment 
 
Do not eat, drink, chew gum, apply cosmetics or smoke while conducting an experi-ment.   
 
Work in a well ventilated area and monitor experiments at all times, unless instructed otherwise. 
 
When working with chemicals: 
 
Never return unused chemicals to their original container to avoid contamination.  
 
Never place chemicals in an unmarked container to avoid identification or proper disposal problems. 
 
Always put lids back onto chemicals immediately after use to avoid contamination or potential hydration problems. 
 
Never ingest chemicals.  If this occurs, seek immediate help. 
 
 
Call 911 or "Poison Control" 1-800-222-1222
 
 
Never pipette anything by mouth. 
 
Never leave a heat source unattended. 
 
If there is a fire, evacuate the room immediately and dial 911. 
 
Lab Clean-up and Disposal 

  If a spill occurs, consult the MSDS to determine how to clean it up. 
 
Never pick up broken glassware with your hands.  Use a broom and a dustpan and discard in a safe area. 
 
Do not use any part of the lab kit as a container for food. 
 
Safely dispose of chemicals.  If there are any special requirements for disposal, it will be noted in the lab manual. 
 
When finished, wash hands and lab equipment thoroughly with soap and water.   
Above all, use common sense! Read the manual carefully. Pay close attention 
to the safety concerns prior to starting an experiment.

Mnemonics 
A useful tool to remembering the order of the Linnaean classification system is developed by creating a mne-monic phrase using the first letter of each classification. For example, Daring  Kids  Pick  Cauliflower  Over Fresh Grown Strawberries. Can you create any mnemonics to help remember the Linnaean classification sys-tem?  
Binomial Nomenclature 
Carl Linnaeus also helped to standardize the naming of species by introducing the binomial (two name) spe-cies name. Binomial nomenclature uses the genus and species as the formal name of all organisms. For example, human beings are Homo sapiens. Note that the genus is capitalized while species is not and, since these are Latin names, they are italicized.  
 
Organisms and Lineage
 
The three domains  of life include eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea. Interestingly, there is not a consensus definition of 'species' among scientists at this time. The biological species  concept is the most commonly used definition. Basically it defines a species as a group of individuals that can interbreed and create viable offspring. Sub-species are used in some classifications and is generally accepted, but not always included in the Linnaean system.   The last universal common ancestor (LUCA) is considered the most recent common ancestor of all life on Earth including all prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) and eukaryotes. Prokaryotes  are extremely adaptable and can inhabit many obscure and ordinarily treacherous environments. They are the oldest known organ-isms on the Earth. In fact, some bacteria are estimated to be approximately 3.5 billion years old (almost as old as the Earth itself!). Prokaryotes are unicellular organisms enclosed by a bilayer membrane with no cyto-

plasmic, membrane-bound structures. Most prokaryotes have a unique layer surrounding the cell membrane called the cell wall.   
Protista Kingdom  
Although there are six major kingdoms, this lab will focus on the Protista, Plantae, and Animalia kingdoms. The kingdom Protista  contains eukaryotic organisms which are not fungi, plants or animals. This includes protozoa, algae, and slime molds. Protozoans are unicellular, chemoheterotrophic microorganisms that re-side in water and soil. The word 'protozoa' actually means first animals (think prototype). Protozoa include amoebas, sporozoa, ciliates, and flagellates.   Algae are photosynthetic autotrophs, meaning they possess chlorophyll and often other photosynthetic pigments. A select few are also hetero-trophs, making them a mixotroph (an organism that has the ability to be photosynthetic as well as heterotrophic). There are three main types of algae: green algae, red algae and brown algae, each of which is distinct. They produce over half of the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere and are used for a number of commercial applications (to create ice cream, shaving cream, air fresheners, laxatives, dyes, pastry fillings, syrups and more).    
Slime molds are often considered the link to the Fungi kingdom, and share many similarities with this kingdom such as appearance, and the ability to form spores. However, there are some key differentiators as well, including reproductive ability, life cycle and cellular make-up. Slime molds are phagocytic heterotrophs, meaning they surround and engulf particles with cytoplasm protrusions. They possess a complex reproductive cycle which includes a mobile component (similar to that of animals), and an 
immobile component (similar to that of plants) when spore formation oc-curs. 
 
Plantae Kingdom  
The Plantae kingdom includes flowering plants, ferns, mosses, and conifers. Plants are multicellular eukary-otic organisms that obtain most of their energy from sunlight. Like algae, plants produce energy using photo-synthesis, the process through which most of the planet's oxygen is produced. 
 
Animalia Kingdom 
The kingdom Animalia contains multicellular eukaryotes such as birds, amphibians, reptiles, insects, and mammals. All animals are heterotrophic relying on other organisms for energy sources. Additionally, they do

not have cell walls distinguishing them from plants and fungi. Animals are frequently classified as either ver-tebrates or invertebrates based on the presence or absence of a backbone or spinal column.   
Advances in Taxonomy
 
Taxonomy is in a constant state of flux. Traditional groupings of organisms were dependent on mostly mor-phological traits, physiological similarities and, to some extent, embryological events. Consider what tech-niques were available in the 1700s when Carl Linnaeus described his system for ranking life. Gross anato-my could be studied and identified, but most forms of microscopy were not available.  
 
Phylogenetics 
With advances in molecular techniques, nucleic acid (DNA) sequences are used to classify organisms based on their evolutionary history. These advancements have given birth to the field of phylogenetics. Phy-logenetics is the field of study that determines the evolutionary relationships among groups of organisms using morphological traits, behavioral information and molecular data. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is currently one of the genes of choice for phylogenetic studies. rRNA is necessary for the production of proteins and, because all life forms require proteins, it follows that all organisms include rRNA genes. Sequences from specific regions of an rRNA gene demonstrate similarities amongst different organisms, enabling evolution-ary relationships to be explored. It is well accepted that the more similar the sequences are between two organisms, the more closely related the organisms. As DNA sequencing techniques improve (and costs de-crease) other regions of the genome are also being sequenced and compared.   
Hot Topics in Taxonomy 
Keep in mind that new techniques aid in classifications and, at the same time, cause previously well accept-ed classifications to become obsolete. Currently, many sources list the six kingdoms as Bacteria, Archaea, Protista, Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia. The Kingdom Protista has historically been a 'catch-all' category for all single-celled eukaryotic organisms; but, not plants, fungi or animals. However, molecular data has re-vealed distinct relationships within the eukaryotes that has led to suggestions for new kingdoms and "supergroups". In this proposal, organisms that share a common ancestor are grouped together and organ-isms that were previously placed in the Kingdom Protista are distributed throughout the new categories. Re-call that the organization of organisms based on shared common ancestors is considered phylogeny. The recently suggested revised "supergroups" are Bacteria, Archaea, Excavata, Amoebozoa, Opisthokonta, Rhi-zaria, Chromalveolata, and Archaeplastida. In this organizational system, animals fall within Opisthokonta and plants are placed in Archaeplastida. Classifications will continue to evolve as scientists are able to delve at increasingly deeper molecular levels.

Experiment 1: Classification of Common Objects 
In this exercise, we will take common objects and group them into "taxonomic" categories. 
 
Procedure 
1.  Spread the materials out on a flat work surface.  
2.  Use the flow chart (Figure 4; located after this procedure) to classify the objects. Answer the questions 
for each object and place them in the proper groups. Fill in all the boxes along the way. If the box says 
"ok" in it, only one object fits in this category and you have identified one of the items. Next to that box, 
write the object that is being described.

Introduction 
A cell is the fundamental unit of life. All living organisms originate from a single cell. Some remain as a single cell, while others grow and divide to form a multi-cellular organism. Though most cells are difficult to see with the naked eye, cytologists (scientists who study cells) have successfully identified many of their features us-ing the microscope. The scope of these features ranges from the fundamental characteristics of the outer membranes, to the internal structures nestled within the cytoplasm. This structural information provided the foundation for much of modern biology, and formed the basis of Cell Theory.     Cell Theory states:  
1.  All living things are made of cell(s). 2.  All cells are generated from previous cells. 3.  All cells pass on genetic information. 4.  Energy metabolism occurs within cells. 5.  The chemical make-up of all cells is similar (but not identical). 
 
Functional Requirements of Life 
The functional requirements of life are similar to the content presented in Cell Theory. In essence, these re-quirements state that all living organisms (unicellular or multicellular) must perform the following functions:  
1.  Movement: Cells can change position or shape. 2.  Responsiveness: Cells can sense internal or external changes; and, react to these changes. 3.  Respiration/Metabolism: Cells produce energy through cellular chemical reactions 4.  Reproduction: Cells are able to produce offspring. 5.  Excretion: Cells can remove waste produced by metabolic activities.

Unicellular Organisms  
Unicellular Organisms 
There are three domains that contain all the known organisms: Domain Bacte-ria, Domain Archaea, and Domain Eukarya. The vast majority of life on Earth exists as single cell organisms. You may recall that organisms are classified as either prokaryotes or eukaryotes based on the absence or presence of a distinct nucleus. "Karyose" is a Greek word meaning "kernel" and in biological terms represents the nucleus. "Pro-" means before and "Eu-" mean true; therefore, prokaryotic means before nucleus; prokaryotes (bacteria and ar-chaea) do not have a distinct nucleus. Eukaryotic means true nucleus; eukar-yotes do have a distinct nucleus.   
Bacteria 
Bacteria  cell structure is overall much more simple that than of eukaryotes, with the exception of the cell membrane, which is much more complex. Inter-nally, there is no nuclear membrane and DNA exists as a single, continuous, circular molecule that varies in size among different organisms. Like eukaryot-ic DNA, bacterial DNA is bound by special proteins that allow it to be pack-aged within the cell.   A cell wall surrounds the cell membrane of most, but not all, bacteria. It  is composed of peptidoglycan, which is formed by repeating units of 2 sugars (glycan) with 4 amino acid side arms (peptido) interconnected so that the repeating units form a molecule that resembles a chain-link fence. This cross-linking leads to a very strong and semi-rigid, 3-dimensional structure that further serves to protect the bacteria and provide support. Interestingly, the cell wall makes an excellent target for antibiotics since it is unique to bacteria.

1 - Mesosome. Folds in the plasma membrane which increase the surface area and aid in res-piration. Only present in some prokaryotes. 
2 - Nucleoid. Contains a circular loop of DNA with a small amount of RNA and proteins. 
3 - Ribosomes. Small, dense structure in-volved in protein formation. 
4 - Plasma Membrane. Semi-permeable layer which provides structural support and regu-lates what enters and exits the cell.  
5 - Cytoplasm. Fluid bound by the plasma membrane. Environment for most cellular ac-tivity. 
6 - Cell Wall. Tough outer layer which provides strength, support, protection, and filtration.

Unicellular Organisms  
Morphology 
Bacteria occur in a variety of morphologies, and are often classified by this feature. Some of the most common shapes include spheres (cocci), rods (bacilli), spiral (spirilla), comma-shaped (vibrio), and filamentous forms. Spherical bacteria are re-ferred to as cocci, and can occur singly or in clusters ranging from two to many cells. Common examples of spherical bacteria are Streptococcus (which form chains) and Staphylococcus (which assume a "cluster of grapes" shape).     Rod-shaped bacteria are called bacilli. Some examples are Escherichia coli (a com-mon gut-inhabiting microbe), Bacillus cereus (which may cause food poisoning) and Bacillus anthracis (which produces the causative agent of anthrax [often used as a biological weapon]).   Spiral, or spirilla, bacteria include Treponema species, responsible for the sexually transmitted disease syphi-lis, and Campylobacter, a common cause of food poisoning. Comma-shaped bacteria include Vibrio cholera, which is the causative agent of cholera.  
Eukaryotes
 
Eukaryotes are structurally much more complex than bacteria. However, some bacteriologists would argue that the ability of bacteria to occupy extremely varied environments makes them functionally much more com-plex than eukaryotes! Eukaryotic cells have a phospholipid and protein cell membrane enclosing a cytoplasm containing cellular organelles of specific and diverse function. Organelles (mini-organs) are membrane-bound compartments that allow independent biochemical processes to occur simultaneously. The nucleus also re-sides within the cytoplasm, and contains DNA.  Eukaryotic cells have a protein-rich cytoskeleton that provides three dimensional structural support, tensile strength, cell-associated movements (gliding, contraction and cytokinesis), and acts as an 'intracellular highway' for molecules traveling through the cytoplasm.  Microscopic eukaryotes include fungi, protozoa, algae, and slime molds. Protozoa, algae and slime molds have historically been placed in the kingdom Protista (more information about these organisms can be found in the Hierarchies of Life Lab!). Keep in mind that advances in molecular techniques have allowed for a more accurate classification of many of these organisms.

Unicellular Organisms  
Eukaryotic Organelles 
The following list provides a brief description of some of the most common eukaryotic structures. 
 
Cytoskeleton: The cell "skeleton" found in all eukaryotic cells that provides shape to the cell while also enabling it to move.   
 
Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): A series of membranes extending throughout the cytoplasm that can be peppered with ribosomes (rough ER) or not (smooth ER). The rough ER functions in protein synthesis while the smooth ER functions in lipid synthesis. 
 
Golgi Apparatus (also called the Golgi Body): A series of flattened sac-like bodies that pro-cesses the cell's proteins and lipids before they are released to their final destination. 
 
Lysosomes: Enzyme-filled vesicles found within the cell that aid in intracellular digestion. 
 
Mitochondrion (plural: mitochondria): The "power plant" of the cell. These are membrane bound organelles  (inner and outer membrane) with their own circular DNA, and make ATP (energy) for the rest of the cell. 
 
Nuclear Envelope: An outer membrane that surrounds the nucleus. 
 
Nuclear Pores: Holes in the nuclear envelope that permit communication between the internal nucle-ar environment and the cytoplasm.  
 
Nucleus: Houses the genetic content (DNA) of the cell. 
 
Nucleolus (plural: nucleoli): A part of the nucleus that is made of RNA, protein and chromatin; and, manufactures rRNA and ribosomes. 
 
Peroxisomes: Contain enzymes that help the cell destroy toxins. 
 
Ribosomes:  Ribosomes are large molecules found in all living cells. Ribosomes the site of protein synthesis. A strand of mRNA docks onto a ribosome. The correct amino acids are then recruited to the ribosome to create a protein.  
 
Vacuole: A fluid-filled organelle that helps isolate its contents from the cytoplasm.

Unicellular Organisms  
Fungi 
The Fungi kingdom contains more than 100,000 species. Similar to bacteria, many fungi are beneficial to animals and plants, while others are pathogenic. Fungi structure includes cell walls composed of polysac-charides such as glucans (also found in plant cell walls) and chitin (also found in the exoskeletons of arthro-pods).   Fungi can reproduce by both asexual and sexual means, and many of their life cycles can be rather com-plex. Divisions of the kingdom Fungi are based on two primary features: sexual spores and whether the hy-phae are septate or coenocytic. Septate hyphae are separated by cell walls whereas coenocytic hyphae are continuous or non-septate.  
Fungi: Yeasts vs. Molds 
Fungi are commonly grouped into two categories: yeasts and molds (filamentous). Yeast cells are unicellular, spherical or oval in shape. Yeast cells can grow as a large macroscopic colony on ap-propriate growth platforms (media). They can per-form either aerobic respiration or anaerobic respi-ration (fermentation). Mold structures consist of individual filaments, called hyphae, that grow to-gether to form a mycelium. Hyphae grow through elongation. After time, mycelium can grow large enough to become visible and appears fuzzy.   Some fungi can grow as either yeasts or molds, depending on environmental conditions. These types of fungi are called dimorphic fungi since they display two growth patterns or forms. Many pathogenic fungi fall into the dimorphic category. Consider the fact that fungi are eukaryotes as are humans; it is difficult to find a target for antifungal medication that would not affect human cells as well. Think about what component(s) of fungal cell walls are not found in human cells. Do you think that might make a good target?   One common fungi is Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This eukaryotic microorganism is more commonly referred to simply as baker's or brewer's yeast. S. cerevisiae is used in bread, beer, and wine pro-

duction. Another common fungi is Rhizopus stolonifer, which is the fungus responsible for the dark green or black mold that sometimes forms on old bread. Mushrooms are also well known and are the fruiting bodies of a variety of fungi.  
Fungi: Living Requirements 
Fungi are unable to ingest food and nutrients the way that animals can. Instead, like bacteria, they must ab-sorb nutrients rather than ingesting them. Fungi secrete enzymes into their surroundings to help breakdown their food source and facilitate the absorption process. This enables them to use different carbohydrate sources for food and energy, such as those found in wood, which many bacteria cannot access.  Fungi also have different growth requirements than bacteria. This can sometimes enable them to grow in places which bacteria can-not. For example, fungi can grow at a pH of 5, which is too acidic for most bacteria. Some fungi can also tolerate higher osmotic pres-sures than bacteria can. This enables them to grow in areas with higher solute concentrations. In this experiment, you will determine which factors encourage mold (filamentous fungi) growth on pieces of bread and apples.   
Archaea 
Archaea were first detected in extreme environments such as the hot springs in Yellowstone National Park, USA. Archaea have cell walls that lack the peptidoglycan found in bacteria cell walls. They frequently perform atypical metabolic processes and live in extreme environments (e.g., very high temperatures, extreme acidity, high salt concentrations, etc.). In fact, archaea are sometimes referred to as extremophiles although not all members of archaea are found in extreme environments.  Archaea were initially thought to be a type of bacteria, however, molecular and biochemical studies eluci-dated remarkable differences between archaea and bacteria. For example, the rRNA sequences of archaea are more closely related to eukaryotes than bacteria. Furthermore, the cell membrane of bacteria is structurally more similar to that of eukaryotes than that of archaea.

stone National Park. The green and or-ange colors are derived from microor-ganisms that grow in high acidity  (pH of 2 - 3) and temperatures (80 - 90 &#176;C). The-se areas are typically high in sulfur; many microbes living here metabolize sulfur, rather than oxygen, for survival.

The most prevalent chemical dissolved in the deep ocean waters near hydrothermal vents is hydrogen sul-fide. The specialized bacteria that live near these vents use hydrogen sulfide as their energy source, instead of sunlight (chemoautotrophs). The bacteria, in turn, sustain larger organisms in the surrounding area. The clams, mussels, tube worms, and other creatures at the vent have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria. 
The giant tube worms have no mouth or gut to digest food. In-stead, the worm depends on the bacteria that have invaded its body to survive. There are around 285 billion bacteria per ounce of tissue within this tube worm. The plumes at the top of the worm's body are filled with blood, which contains hemoglobin that binds hydrogen sulfide and transports it to the bacteria that lives within the tissue. In return, the bacteria oxidize the hydrogen sul-fide and convert carbon dioxide into carbon compounds that nourish the worm. They could not live without each other!

7.  Place one piece of bread and one slice of apple in a plastic bag. Repeat this process until you have 10 
bags, each with one piece of bread and one slice of apple. 
8.  Add one tsp. tap water to each bag with a label that includes the word "Water".  
9.  Add one tsp. of the sugar-water solution (prepared in Steps 1 - 3) to each bag with a label that includes 
the word "Sugar". 
10. Add one packet of lemon juice to each bag with a label that includes the word "Lemon".  
11. Add one tsp. white vinegar to each bag with a label that includes the word "Vinegar".  
Note: 
Do not add anything to the bags labeled "Control". 
12. Find a well-lit, warm location to place each bag with a label that includes the word "Bright". This may be 
on a sunny windowsill, under a lamp, etc. 
13. Find a dark, warm location  to place each bag with a label that includes the word "Dark". This may in-
clude in a closet, near a heater (with the lights off), etc. 
14. Examine the bags every 1 - 2 days for two weeks. Look for mold formation on the bread and apple piec-
es. Take particular note to which environmental condition(s) the mold formed in first and last. Also, make 
sure to note which environmental condition(s) grew the most and least mold. Use the following scale to 
assess the extent of mold growth: 
0 = None 
1 = Little/some (1-25%) 
2 = Moderate (26-50%) 
3 = Heavy (51-75%) 
4 = Extensive (76-100%) 
 
15. Record your results in Table 2.

Experiment 2: Yogurt Preparation 
Bacterial fermentation allows milk to be stored safely and consumed much later than would be possible with fresh milk. Fermentation has been used for centuries to provide nutrients for nomadic tribes and oth- er people without ready access to fresh milk. This is an instance where bacteria are used in a beneficial manner to prepare a food product. 
Procedure:  
 1.  Place sauce pan on stove or hot plate. Add four cups (approximately 950 mL) of milk to a sauce pan. 
Reserve a small amount (approximately one tablespoon) of the milk for later use. 
2.  Measure the pH of the reserved milk using a pH indicator strip. Record the pH in Table 3. 
3.  Place the sauce pan onto a stove and gently heat at medium-low.  
4.  Insert the thermometer into the milk. Monitor the milk and thermometer until it is approximately 85 &#176;C.  
Note: 
Do not stir the milk with the thermometer. 
5.  Use hot pads to remove the pan from the heat. Keep the thermometer submerged, and allow the milk 
to cool to 43 &#176;C.

lows for moisture and gasses to escape.  
13.Incubate the mixture in a warm place (30 - 32 &#176;C) for 5 - 6 hours. If you don't have a warm place to incu-
bate the yogurt, wrap the bowl with a hot pad or blanket (if you have one). Set the hot pad or blanket to 
a low setting and allow it to sit for approximately 3 - 4 hours.  
14. Use a stir rod to check the yogurt's consistency after the recommended incubation time. It should be 
"set" and have a consistency similar to store-bought yogurt. If it is not set, incubate the yogurt for an ad-
ditional 1 - 2 hours.  
15. Remove a small amount (approximately 1 tablespoon) of the set yogurt; measure the pH using a new 
pH indicator strip. Record the pH in Table 3. 
16. Place the yogurt in a refrigerator for 24 hours. After 24 hours, remove a small amount (approximately 1 
tablespoon) of the yogurt; measure the pH using a new pH strip. Record the pH in Table 3.

Introduction 
http://cartridges.esciencelabs.com/GeneralBiology/GBCA/MitosisAndMeiosis/multiscreen.html
All of a cell's hereditary information is encoded by the genome. The genome contains the genes that direct the formation of all the proteins the cell needs to survive. In prokaryotes, the genomeconsistsof the bacteri-al chromosome(s) and plasmids.
 
In eukaryotes, the genome is encoded by chromatin. Chromatin is composed of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and proteins. DNA is a double-stranded molecule, constructed from repeating units of a phosphate, a sugar (deoxyribose), and one of four possible nitrogenous bases - adenine, thymine, cytosine, or guanine. Units which incorporate these three structures are called nucleotides. Hydrogen bonds between comple- mentary nucleotides (adenine and thymine [A - T] and cytosine to guanine [C - G]) hold the two DNA strands together. Theoretically, the DNA from a single human cell is so long that it would stretch over two  meters long if fully uncoiled. As a result, special proteins called histones associate with DNA to condense it into chromatin and further condense it into chromosomes during cell cycle division.
 
Heredity 
Genes are stretches of DNA that encode RNA and polypeptide (protein) products. They are often described as units of heredity. Genes have specific loci (locations) on the DNA strand and code for inheritable traits (such as hair color). The human genome is comprised of 23 pairs of chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes carry the  same genes but often different versions, or, alleles. Alleles are alter- native forms of the same gene (e.g., brown eyes vs. blue eyes). Differ- ent species may have a different number of chromosomes, as well as a different number of copies of each chromosome. Species with more than two copies of each chromosome are considered polyploidy. For

than two copies of each chromosome are considered polyploidy. For example, human somatic cells have two copies (2n; or, diploid) of 23 chromosomes, resulting in 46 chromo-somes per cell. On the contrary, somatic kiwifruit cells have six copies (hexaploidy) of 29 chromosomes, re-sulting in 174 chromosomes per cell. Almost all somatic, mammalian cells have two sets of chromosomes. One set originates from the original egg cell and one set originates from the original sperm cell (this results in homologous chromosomes, or two alleles per cell). Cell cycle division generates two new diploid daughter cells from one original parent cell. Each new daughter cell contains two complete sets of chromosomes. The cellular content is identical to the parent cell as long as no mutations or errors occur during cell cycle division.
  
Cell Cycle Division 
Cell cycle division is divided into three phases: interphase, mitosis, and cytokinesis. These phases are fur-ther broken down into individual stages. These stages are identified as: 
 
1. Interphase:  
 
Gap 1 Phase (G
1
): The first stage of interphase; or, the first growth phase. 
 
S Phase: DNA synthesis. The second stage of interphase. 
 
Gap 2 Phase (G
2
): The third stage of interphase; or, the second growth stage.  
 
2. Mitosis:  
 
Prophase 
 
Metaphase 
 
Anaphase 
 
Telophase 
 
3. Cytokinesis: 
 
There are no further subdivided stag-es within cytokinesis.  
 
http://cartridges.esciencelabs.com/The-Cell-Cycle.swf
A cell normally completes the cycle in 18 - 24 hours. Mi-tosis only occupies one to two hours of that period. Dur-ing interphase, the cell prepares for mitosis and cytoki-nesis by growing larger in size, duplicating its internal organelles (G
1
), replicating its DNA (S) and preparing for 
cell division (G
2
). You can easily remember the activity

Mitosis and Meiosis 
which occurs during the S phase because it is when new DNA is synthesized (synthesized starts with s). When the full set of DNA is replicated, two identical copies of each chromosome exist in the parent cell. These identical copies pair up and are referred to as sister chromatids. Sister chromatids exist as chro-matin during interphase. These structures don't condense into chromosomes until mitosis. A structure called the centromere pairs the sister chromatids, forming the traditional "X" shaped of the chromosome. The centromere is the site of spindle fiber attachment later in cell cycle division.
 
After the DNA is fully replicated, the cell engages in "proofreading" and additional protein production (G
2
). In 
this process, proteins involved in DNA replication (such as DNA polymerase) review the replicated content and correct any errors which may have been made during replication. G
1
 and G
2
 are also responsibly for 
initiating a variety of checkpoints which verify that the size and environmental growth factors are sufficient prior to entering mitotic division. 
 
http://cartridges.esciencelabs.com/Cell_Division.swf
Mitosis 
 
Mitosis follows interphase. Sister chromatids segregate into two daughter cells during mitosis. The four stages of mitosis are described below: 
 
Prophase: DNA condenses into chromosomes. Centromeres attach themselves to coiled (condensed) sister chromatids to hold their structure together. The nuclear envelope of the par-ent cell breaks down. Pairs of centrioles, which serve as cellular anchors during division, appear at the mitotic spindle, located at the cellular poles at separate sides of the cell.
 
Metaphase: Sister chromatids migrate towards the metaphase plate. Microtubules (long strands) grow from the centrioles and link together while attaching to each pair of sister chroma-tids. The orientation of each pair of sister chromatids is independent from all other pairs. This means they can "flip flop" as they line up, effectively shuffling their genetic information into new combinations
 
Anaphase: The microtubules attached to the centromeres shorten This causes the sister chro-matids to separate and move toward opposite poles of the parent cell. At this point, each sister chromatid is now an individual chromosome. Microtubules attached to other microtubules from the opposite pole lengthen, effectively elongating the cell.
 
Telophase: One set of chromosomes arrives at each pole. A new nuclear envelope begins to form, chromosomes are uncoiled back into chromatin, and a new nucleus is formed at each end of the cell.
 
Cell cycle division concludes with cytokinesis. During animal cell cytokinesis, the plasma membrane of the cell furrows inward and encloses around each nucleus, creating two, diploid daughter cells.

Figure 3:
 
Cell cycle division, including the stages of mitosis. 
Plant vs. Animal Cell Mitosis  
Mitosis is virtually identical in plant and animal cells, however, there is one small difference which occurs during telophase. Plants, due to the presence of a cell wall, cannot "pinch" the cytoplasm into two daughter cells. Instead, a new cell wall must be developed which will then separate the two cells, allowing them both to be fully covered with a cell wall.

Mitosis and Meiosis 
Meiosis 
Meiosis, also known as gametogenesis, only occurs in sexually-reproducing organisms (plants and ani-mals). It is similar to mitosis, but involves a second round of cell division, therefore producing four daugh-ter cells instead of two. In humans, meiosis generates four haploid cells in both males and females. The-se cells are called gametes. Male gametes are referred to as sperm cells, while female gametes are re-ferred to as egg cells. Haploid gametes fuse during fertilization to form a diploid cell. The newly fused cell now contains two copies of each chromosome. All future cells produced through mitosis from this fused cell will also contain two copies of each chromosome (this is unlike the somatic cells produced through mitosis, because they already contain two copies of chromosomal content). The two rounds of cell divi-sion are called meiosis one and meiosis two.   
Meiosis One
 
Meiosis one produces two haploid cells from the primary gamete. The stages of meiosis one mirror the stages you learned about in mitosis. This includes prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. How-ever, because there are two rounds of meiosis, each stage also receives a "1" or a "2" after the name, depending on which round of division the cell is currently in. These stages are also indicated with Roman Numerals, but for the purpose of clarity, this lab manual will spell out the stage number. You may recall that mitosis is also preceded by a period called interphase during which cellular content is duplicated and DNA is proofread for accuracy. The same is true for meiosis, as an interphase period prepares the cell for successful meiotic division.  The stages of meiosis one are outlined as follows:  
 
Prophase One: DNA condenses into chromosomes. Centromeres attach themselves to coiled (condensed) sister chromatids to hold their structure together. Homologous chromo-somes pair up and form a chiasma. Crossing over may occur at this point. This means that homologous chromosomes may exchange and recombine regions of DNA. Crossing over cre-ates a unique genetic fingerprint for the daughter cells, and contributes to the diversity seen in progeny. Similar to mitotic prophase, the nuclear envelope of the parent cell breaks down in this phase as well. Pairs of centrioles, which serve as cellular anchors during division, appear at the mitotic spindle, located at the cellular poles.  
 
 Metaphase One: Homologous chromosomes migrate towards the metaphase plate. Microtu-bules grow from the centrioles and either link together or attach to each pair of homologous chromosomes at the centromeres. The orientation of each pair of sister chromatids is inde-pendent from all other pairs. This action is referred to at the Law of Independent Assort-ment.  This means the chromosomes can "flip flop" as they line up, effectively shuffling their genetic information into new combinations, providing a second source of genetic variation.

Mitosis and Meiosis 
 
Anaphase One: Microtubules attached to chromosomes. They then shorten in length, which pulls the homologous chromosomes apart (sister chromatids remain paired) and moving them toward opposite poles. Microtubules attached to other microtubules from opposite poles length-en to elongate the cell.  
 
 
Telophase One: One set of sister chromatids arrives at each pole. A new nuclear envelope be-gins to form, chromosomes are uncoiled back into chromatin, and a new nucleus is formed at each end of the cell.   
 
Cytokinesis follows meiosis one, deepening the cellular cleavage formed in telophase one and fully dividing the two new daughter cells by engulfing each nuclei within the plasma membrane.   It is important to note that unlike mitosis, meiosis one creates haploid (not diploid) cells. This is because the homologous chromosomes during the first found of meiosis. They do not divide into the same cells. Instead, the sister chromatids remain coupled and are partitioned into the cell products. Therefore, the two daughter cells produced from meiosis one contain identical genetic content. They only contain one copy of the ge-nome because all of the alleles are the same.  
Meiosis Two
 
Meiosis two provides a second round of cellular division during which the two haploid cells are further di-vided and produce four haploid gamete cells. At this point, the sister chromatids separate and each gamete contains one copy of each chromosome. For humans, each gamete contains one copy of each of the 23 chromosomes. A complete set of 46 chromosomes is created when a sperm and an egg cell fuse together. The meiosis two stages are described as follows: 
 
 
Prophase Two: New spindle fibers form as the nucleus break down again. Chromosomes con-dense in the form of sister chromatids. 
 
 
Metaphase Two: Sister chromatids migrate towards the metaphase plate. Similar to metaphase one, microtubules attach to the centromeres. 
 
 
Anaphase Two: This time, sister chromatids (rather than homologous chromosomes) are sepa-rated as the microtubules shorten and pull them apart. The cell elongates as microtubules at-tached to additional microtubules from opposing poles lengthen. 
 
 
Telophase Two: 23 chromatids arrive at each pole. A new nucleus forms around each.  
 Cytokinesis again follows, resulting in four daughter cells.

Mitosis and Meiosis 
Egg Cells vs. Sperm Cells  
In humans, egg and sperm cell meiosis follows the same pro-cess, but often results in different cell products. Sperm cells engage in a standard meiotic process to produce four, evenly divided gametes. All four gametes are viable for reproductive processes. However, egg cell division is a little more complex. The primary oocyte (the initial dividing cell) divides to produce two haploid cells after meiosis one. However, the primary oo-cyte often divides unevenly. This results in one polar body and one daughter cell are produced, instead of two equal daughter cells. Both of these products are haploid, but the polar body tends to contain less cytoplasm and is much smaller than the daughter cell (now referred to as the secondary oocyte).

Mitosis and Meiosis 
If a polar body is produced in meiosis one, it may divide to produce two more polar bodies in meiosis two. The secondary oocyte also produces one more polar body in meiosis two. Thus, three polar bodies and one mature ovum are the finished products of meiosis one and two. The three polar bodies typically apop-tose (cell death), leaving the mature ovum as the only gamete to survive for future reproductive purposes.  
 
Checkpoints and Mutations 
Mitotic and meiotic division are both complex and highly regulated process-es. Each stage is regulated by specialized proteins, such as cyclins and cy-clin-dependent kinases (CDKs) that coordinate the division and cell growth. When these checkpoints function properly, mutations and errors are identi-fied and repaired. Some of these checkpoints include verifying that ample nutrients are available for division, and proofreading replicated DNA strands. Problems which are found may result in a pause within meiosis to allow the appropriate proteins sufficient time to repair the error. If the error can't be repaired, the cell may attempt apoptosis. 
 
Checkpoints that are missing or do not function correctly may result in ge-netic mutations. Genetic mutations which occur in somatic cells are not her-itable mutations. This means that the mutation will not be propagated amongst progeny. Mutations which occur in gametes are heritable mutations which risk genetic expression amongst future generations. One mutation of particular concern is when the amount of genetic material existing in a cell changes. It is critical that a gamete contains only one copy of each chromosome found in a parent cell. Certain types of cancer are also associated with the failure of these checkpoint  proteins.

Did You Know... 
 
There are many types of muta-tions. These range in scale from silent to lethal, and may affect a single nucleotide or a full chromosome. Trisomy 21, or Down's Syndrome, is one example of a chromosomal abnormality. In this disease, three copies of chromosome 21 exist rather than the stand-ard two copies. This type of abnormality is typically lethal, however, chromosome 21 is much smaller than many other chromosomes and thus the progeny are viable.

Experiment 1: Observation of Mitosis in a Plant Cell
 
In this experiment, we will look at the different stage of mitosis in an onion cell. Remember that mitosis only occupies one to two hours while interphase can take anywhere from 18 - 24 hours. Using this information and your experiment data, you can estimate the percentage of cells in each stage of the cell cycle.
 
Procedure
 
1.  The length of the cell cycle in the onion root tip is about 24 hours. Predict how many hours of the 24 
hour cell cycle each step takes. Record your predictions, along with supporting evidence, in Table 1. 
2.  Examine the onion root tip slide images on the following pages. There are four images, each displaying 
a different field of view. Pick one of the images, and count the number of cells in each stage. Then count the total number of cells in the image. Record the image you selected and counts in Table 2.  
3. 
Calculate the time spent by a cell in each stage based on the 24 hour cycle:
 
4.  Locate the region just above the root cap tip.  
5.  Locate a good example of a cell in interphase, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.  
6.  Draw the dividing cell in the appropriate area for each stage of the cell cycle. Include your drawings in 
Table 3.

Experiment 2: Following Chromosomal DNA Movement through Mitosis  
Although mitosis and meiosis share similarities, they are different processes and create very different results.  In this experiment, you will follow the movement of the chromosomes through mitosis to create somatic daughter cells. 
Procedure 
Mitosis 
Genetic content is replicated during interphase. DNA exists as loose molecular strands called chromatin; it has not condensed to form chromosomes yet. 
Sister chromatids begin coiling into chromosomes during prophase. Begin your experiment here: 
1.  Build a pair of replicated, homologous chromosomes. 10 beads should be used to create each individual 
sister chromatid (20 beads per chromosome pair). The five-holed bead represents the centromere. To do this... 
a.  Start with 20 red beads to create your first sister chromatid pair. Five beads must be snapped togeth-
er for each of the four different strands. Two strands create the first chromatid, and two strands cre-ate the second chromatid.  
b.  Place the five-holed bead flat on a work surface with the 
node positioned up. Then, snap each of the four strands into the bead to create an "X" shaped pair of sister chromo-somes.  
c.  Repeat this process using 20 new beads (of a different col-
or) to create the second sister chromatid pair. See Figure 6 for reference. 
2.  Assemble a second pair of replicated sister chromatids; this time 
using 12 beads, instead of 20, per pair (six beads per each com-plete sister chromatid strand). Snap each of the four pieces into a new five-holed bead to complete the set up.  
3.  Repeat this process using 12 new beads (of a different color) to 
create the second set of sister chromatids. See Figure 7 for refer-ence. 
Figure 6: 
Bead set-up. The blue beads 
represent one pair of sister chromatids and the red beads represent a second pair of sister chromatids.

As prophase I begins, the replicated chromosomes coil and condense... 
1.  Build a pair of replicated, homologous chromosomes. 10 beads should be used to create each individual 
sister chromatid (20 beads per chromosome pair). The five-holed bead represents the centromere. To do this... 
a.  Start with 20 red beads to create your first sister chromatid pair. Five beads must be snapped to-
gether for each of the four different strands. Two strands create the first chromatid, and two strands create the second chromatid.  
b.  Place the five-holed bead flat on a work surface with the node positioned up. Then, snap each of 
the four strands into the bead to create an "X" shaped pair of sister chromosomes.

c.  Repeat this process using 20 new beads (of a different color) to create the second sister chroma-

2.  Assemble a second pair of replicated sister chromatids; this time using 12 beads, instead of 20, per pair 
(six beads per each complete sister chromatid strand). Snap each of the four pieces into a new five-holed bead to complete the set up. See Figure 7 (located in Experiment 2) for reference. 
3.  Pair up the homologous chromosome pairs created in Step 1 and 2. DO NOT SIMULATE CROSSING 
OVER IN THIS TRIAL. You will simulate crossing over in Trial 2. 
5.  Configure the chromosomes as they would appear in each of the stages of meiotic division (prophase I 
and II, metaphase I and II, anaphase I and II, telophase I and II, and cytokinesis).  
6.  Diagram the corresponding images for each stage in the sections titled "Trial 1 - Meiotic Division Beads 
Diagram". Be sure to indicate the number of chromosomes present in each cell for each phase. 
7.  Disassemble the beads used in Trial 1. You will need to recycle these beads for a second meiosis trial in

c.  Repeat this process using 20 new beads (of a different color) to create the second sister chroma-
tid pair. See Figure 5 (located in Experiment 2) for reference. 
9.  Assemble a second pair of replicated sister chromatids; this time using 12 beads, instead of 20, per pair 
(six beads per each complete sister chromatid strand). Snap each of the four pieces into a new five-holed bead to complete the set up. See Figure 6 (located in Experiment 2) for reference. 
10. Pair up the homologous chromosomes created in Step 8 and 9. 
11. SIMULATE CROSSING OVER. To do this, bring the two homologous pairs of sister chromatids together 
(creating the chiasma) and exchange an equal number of beads between the two. This will result in chro-matids of the same original length, there will now be new combinations of chromatid colors.

Experiment 4: Crossing Over

In this lab, pictures of a prepared slide of the fungus Sordaria fimicola will be used to examine the effects of crossing over. The life cycle of this fungus begins in the haploid state. However, after the combination of two different types of strains, they develop a dip-loid nucleus. As the life cycle continues, the diploid nucleus undergoes meiosis, along with mitosis, and produces eight haploid ascospores which are stored in a sac called an ascus (Figure 8). Once maturation has been reached, the sac will burst, allowing the ascospores to be released. These spores are hap-loid and thus begin the life cycle again.  
 
Sordaria fimicola is often used to observe crossing over because the wild type strain has black ascospores and the mutant type has tan ascospores. When the two strains go through meiosis, the location of the asco-spores will directly show if crossing over has occurred.   
If crossover does not occur, the ascospores will be arranged like Figure 9. 
 If 
crossover 
does occur, the ascospores will be arranged like Figure 10.

Table 4: Sordaria fimicola Crossover Data 
The measurement to describe the difference between genes is referred to as map unit. As the distance in-creases between genes, the likelihood of these genes crossing over independently becomes greater, there-fore demonstrating that the proportion of crossovers corresponds with the distance between genes. As a rule, the percentage of recombinations is equal to the number of map units between two genes or a gene and the centromere.

1.  Determine the percentage of crossovers. To do this, divide the number of crossovers by the total number 
of DNA strands and multiply it by 100. 
2.  Determine the map distance. To accomplish this, divide the percentage of crossovers by two. Note: the 
number is divided by two because crossover occurs once between two chromosomes.

Some environmental factors can cause genetic mutations which result in a lack of proper cell cycle control. When this happens, the possibility for uncontrolled cell growth occurs. In some instances, uncontrolled growth can lead to tumors, which are often associated with cancer, or other biological diseases.  
 
In this experiment, you will review some of the karyotypic differences which can be observed when comparing normal, controlled cell growth and abnormal, uncontrolled cell growth. A karyotype is an image of the com-plete set of diploid chromosomes in a single cell. 
 
 
Procedure:
 
1.  Begin by constructing a hypothesis to explain what differences you might observe when comparing the 
karyotypes of human cells which experience normal cell cycle control versus cancerous cells (which expe-rience abnormal, or a lack of, cell cycle control). Record your hypothesis in Post-Lab Question 1. 
Note: 
Be sure to include what you expect to observe, and why you think you will observe these fea-
tures. Think about what you know about cancerous cell growth to help construct this information 
2.  Go online to find some images of abnormal karyotypes, and normal karyotypes. The best results will come 
from search terms such as "abnormal karyotype", "HeLa cells", "normal karyotype", "abnormal chromo-somes", etc. Be sure to use dependable resources which have been peer-reviewed!

3.  Identify at least five abnormalities in the abnormal images, and list them in the Data section at the end of 
this experiment. Do these abnormalities agree with your original hypothesis? 
Hint: 
It may be helpful to count the number of chromosomes, count the number of pairs, compare the 
sizes of homologous chromosomes, look for any missing or additional genetic markers/flags, etc.

body's natural cell cycle control proteins. This mutation resulted in cancer yet, but was effectively treated 
with a cocktail of cancer-fighting techniques. Is it possible for this person's future children to inherit this 
cancer-causing mutation? Be specific when you explain why or why not.

normal cell cycle.

chromosome appears physically different on a karyotype than it appears on a karyotype of normal chro-
mosomes.

The Genetic Code 
 
Mutations 
Introduction 
The genome constitutes the genotype, or potential genetic properties, of an organism, while the actual ex-pressed proteins determine an organism's phenotype (physical traits). The complete genome is duplicated every time a cell replicates.  
Proteins 
Proteins  are the most abundant macromolecule in a living system. Muscles, bones, hormones, enzymes, cell-cell connections, and other vital structures and processes are all dependent on proteins. Protein synthesis is a two-step process. Step one is transcription which in-volves the production of RNA from DNA. The second step, translation, is the production of the protein using the information relayed by the RNA. Similar to a scribe rewriting a book, transcription can be thought of as rewriting the code contained in DNA. Since both DNA and RNA are nucleic acids there is not a change in the "language". That is, during transcription the genetic information is rewritten from one type of nucle-ic acid (DNA) to another type of nucleic acid (RNA). One strand of DNA is transcribed into RNA with the help of a special enzyme, RNA poly-merase. RNA polymerase falls off of the DNA template and stops tran-scription when it reaches a stop region encoded within the DNA. In eu-karyotes the newly transcribed RNA is further processed to become the more stable mRNA. The newly transcribed RNA is the intermediary be-tween the genome and proteins.   mRNA will travel to a ribosome, a cellular organelle (mini-organ). With the coordination of a few additional proteins, new proteins can now be translated from the RNA template on the ribosome. Note that during trans-lation, the information is being translated from a nucleic acid to an amino acid chain, similar to translating one language to another. Specialized amino acids carrying RNA molecules called transfer RNA (or tRNA) read the genetic code by briefly binding to the mRNA using complementary base pairing (A to U and G to C).   The code is read in groups of three nucleotides that code and direct the incorporation of the necessary amino acids to form proteins. These groups of three nucleotides are called codons.

ble combinations of three that could arise from the four nucleo-tides found in RNA (G, C, A, and U) yields 64 codons (4
3
). How-
ever, there are only 20 amino acids that constitute proteins. Therefore, some amino acids are encoded by multiple codons; additionally, three codons do not code for amino acids but signal a stop. The genetic code designates which codon codes for which amino acid. By examining the genetic code, one can determine which amino acids are coded for by which codons. Amino acids that are encoded by multiple codons demonstrate the degeneracy or redundancy of the genetic code. The three codons that signal the termination of translation are called stop codons (non-sense codons). During translation, when a stop codon is presented the new protein is released.

Transcription and Translation 
Mutations 
Mutations, or changes in the nucleotide sequence of DNA, some-times occur due to proofreading errors by DNA polymerase or envi-ronmental mutagens (DNA interacting chemicals and various forms of radiation: x-rays, gamma rays and ultraviolet). If the mutation al-ters a resulting protein's function, it is called a missense mutation. Mutations that do not alter protein function are called silent muta-tions. Mutations that create a stop codon in the middle of the mRNA, thereby prematurely ending translation and resulting in a shortened (and likely non-functional) protein are called nonsense mutations.   Most mutations can be also classified as either point mutations or frameshift mutations. A point mutation occurs when a nucleotide is replaced with an incorrect nucleotide (for example: A for G, G for C, etc.). Point mutations are also called base substitutions. Point mutations in protein coding regions do not necessarily affect the protein's structure due to the redundancy of the genetic code. Frameshift mutations occur when one or more nucleotide pairs are inserted or deleted from the DNA. This can cause the genetic code to be misread during translation and result in a dysfunctional or non-functional protein.  
Although "dogmas" are typically as-sociated with a philosophy or belief system, The Central Dogma refers to the hypothesis that describes biolog-ical processes of transcription and translation. Specifically, The Central Dogma describes: 
DNA 
   (Transcription) 
mRNA 
(Translation) 
Protein 
This fundamental process of reading the genetic code and developing pro-teins from that code drives  life.

Introduction 
All of a cell's hereditary information is encoded by the genome. The genome contains the genes that direct the formation of all the proteins a cell needs to survive. In prokaryotes, the genome consists of a bacterial chromosome(s) and plasmids. In eukaryotes, the genome is encoded by chromosomes. Chromosomes are comprised of DNA and associated proteins which help condense and package the DNA during cell cycle  
Genes - Review 
Genes are stretches of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that encode detectable products such as ribonucleic acid (RNA) and polypeptide (protein) products. They are often described as units of heredity. Genes have specific loci (locations) on the DNA strand and code for inheritable traits (such as hair color). The human ge-nome is comprised of 23 pairs of chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes carry the same genes but often different versions, or, alleles. Alleles are alternative forms of the same gene (e.g., brown vs. blue eyes). Somatic cells (e.g., bone, heart, skin, liver) contain two alleles (2n) for each gene. One allele is supplied by the sperm, and the second is supplied by the egg. When both alleles of a gene are the same they are said to be homozygous, while if they are different they are said to be heterozygous.   
Mendelian Genetics 
In 1866, Gregor Mendel (an Austrian Monk), published a paper enti-tled "Experiments in Plant Hybridization". It went largely unnoticed until 1900 when it was "rediscovered" and subsequently became the basis for what we now refer to as Mendelian Genetics. Mendel was the first to recognize: 
 
Inherited characters are determined by specific factors (now recognized as genes).  
 
These factors occur in pairs (genes). 
 
When gametes form, these factors segregate so that each gamete contains only one copy of each gene.

drogen bonds connect adenine and thymine, while three hydrogen bonds connect cytosine and guanine.

Genetics of Organisms 
Laws of Genetics 
These original observations led to what we now refer to as, the law of segregation and the law of independ-ent assortment. The law of segregation  states that during meiosis, homologous (paired) chromosomes split. The law of independent assortment states that during meiosis, each homologous chromosome has an equal chance of ending up in either gamete, and alleles for individual genes segregate with the chromo-somes on which they are located.  
 
Genotype and Phenotype 
Genes on a chromosome can be described many ways. Genotype and phenotype are two of the most com-mon methods. Genotype refers to the genetic combination of alleles for a particular trait. In other words, genotype represents which alleles are present on a chromosome, but does not indicate which genes will be expressed by the cell. Phenotype refers to the physical qualities which are expressed by the cell.   Phenotype depends on many factors, but one of the most significant factors is the dominant or recessive status of the alleles. The terms dominant and recessive simply refers to different variations of a gene. Domi-nant  alleles encode a characteristic that only requires one copy of the allele to be present in a cell in order for that gene to be physically expressed. On the contrary, recessive  alleles encode a characteristic that re-quires both copies to be present in order to be expressed. Dominant alleles are typically indicated with capi-tal letters, while recessive alleles are represented with lower case letters. To better understand the differ-ence between dominant and recessive alleles concept, let's use corn color and texture as examples. As-sume that:  
 
The gene for kernel color comes in two alleles. 
Y 
represents the dominant allele, and is ex-
pressed as the color yellow. 
y
 represents the recessive allele, and is expressed as the color blue.   
 
The gene for kernel texture is on the same chromosome as the gene for kernel color. 
S
 repre-
sents the dominant texture, and is expressed as smooth.  
s
 represents the recessive allele, and 
is expressed as wrinkled.

In this example, offspring which receive the 
Y
y
, 
y
Y
, or the combination and the 
YY
 combination will be yellow. 
However, only offspring which receive the 
yy
 combination will be blue. Mathematically, this means that 75% 
of the offspring are likely to be yellow, and 25% are likely to be blue. The same ratio is true for the texture ex-pression; 
SS
, 
S
s
, or 
s
S
 will all express a smooth phenotype; whereas only 
ss 
will express the wrinkled phe-
notype. To continue, an example of the combined genotype is 
Y
y
, 
S
s
. This genotype would cause a pheno-
type which is 
Y
ellow and 
S
mooth.  
 
Incomplete Dominance and Codominance 
Alleles can exhibit incomplete dominance and co-dominance. Incomplete dominance occurs when the geno-type is heterozygous, and is physically expressed as a blend between the dominant and the recessive allele. An easily viewed demonstration of incomplete dominance occurs when cross-breeding two plants with dif-ferent colored petals. For example, suppose a cross is performed between a flower with red petals and a flow-er with white petals, and that the allele for red petals is an incomplete dominant allele. The resulting pheno-type is a blend of the white and the red phenotypes. Thus, the offspring are flowers with pink petals.   Unlike incomplete dominance,  codominance occurs when both allelic characteristics are expressed. Refer-ring back to the example above, codominance would create offspring which are both red and  white, rather than pink.   
Punnett Squares 
Punnett squares can be used to predict the genotypes and phenotypes of offspring produced through a monohybrid or dihybrid cross, assuming that the genotypes of the parents are known. A monohybrid cross examines the alleles provided from two gametes for one (mono) particular gene. A dihybrid cross examines the alleles provided from two gametes for two (di) genes. Homozygous crosses are referred to as pure breed-ing.   Figure 4 displays a sample monohybrid cross in a Punnett square. In this simplified example, each parent contributes a single gamete. The resulting first generation (F
1
) offspring are determined by combining the 
gametes of each parent. In Figure 4, the F
1
 genotypes are all 
Y
, 
y
; and the phenotypes are all yellow. The 
cross which results from a cross between two gametes from the F
1
 generation, known as the F
2
 generation, is 
shown in Figure 5.

Punnett squares can also be used to predict the F
1
 for multiple genes involved in a dihybrid cross. Let's ex-
amine this topic by referring back to the corn color and texture genes. In this example, two heterozygous al-leles for two different genes. The resulting F

 phenotypes are: 
 
Yellow &amp; Smooth:  9 
 
Yellow &amp; Wrinkled:  3 
 
Blue &amp; Smooth:  3 
 
Blue &amp; Wrinkled:  1 
  Mendel's contributions to the understanding of genetics and inheritance were plentiful, but his use of the sci-entific method and the statistical analysis of his results has become a cornerstone of science. Data collected from experiments rarely conform to their predicted values. In order to determine whether the deviation be-tween the expected values (hypothesized) and the actual readings is significant, a goodness of fit test must be performed.   
The Chi-Squared Test 
The chi-squared test (X
2
) is an experimental genetics tool used to challenge collected data. Ultimately, it is 
used to validate or discredit an original hypothesis. This data usually reflects phenotypic outcomes obtained from genetic crosses. The chi-squared test evaluates if any deviations found in a data set (i.e., differences between observed data and expected data) were produced by inconsequential chance, or if there were oth-er, unaccounted factor affecting the experimental outcomes. It also provides standards which identify how much deviation can occur before an investigator must conclude that an unknown variable has augmented the results.  The chi-squared test always incorporates what scientists refer to as the null hypothesis. The null hypothe-

Scientists are then able to compare their ac-tual results (or, observed results) to the expected results to determine if their experiment was valid. Ideally, there should not be a significant difference between the expected results theorized by the null hypothesis, and observed results collected in a lab experiment.  The equation used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies in one or more groupings is: 
where X
2
 is the sum of the squared difference between observed (O
i
) and expected (E
i
) data, divided by the 
expected data in all possible categories. The degrees of freedom must then be determined. This can be ac-complished with the following equation:  
where n equals the number of classes. With the degrees of freedom and the probability value used to deter-mine significance (a; found in a chi-squared table), one can compare the chi-squared value to the appropri-ate value in the critical values chart (Table 1). If the chi-squared value is less than the accepted probability value, the hypothesis is accepted. If the chi-squared value is higher than the accepted probability value, the hypothesis is rejected.

The significant level is customarily set at 5.0% to mark the division between deviations which are significant and those which are not significant. It is important to remember that the goal of the chi-squared test is not to obtain a precise value. The goal is to determine whether the deviations from theoretically expected results are of such significance as to invalidate the theory being examined.

Experiment 3: Plant Genetics: Inheritance of Two Genes 
Plants provide a useful model for studying inheritance. In this experiment, you will use Wisconsin Fast Plant tm seeds to evaluate how two genes are passed from parents to their progeny. Anthocyanin is a purple pigment that produces a visible marking in many plants. It is best observed when plants are four to seven days old. The presence of the anthocyaninless gene (anl) in Wisconsin Fast Plants tm regulates expression of the pigment. Homozygous recessive plants (anl/anl) express no purple pigment because the gene is sup-pressed. Heterozygous plants (anl/ANL) and homozygous dominant plants (ANL/ANL), do produce a purple stem phenotype.   The second gene you will track is the yellow-green gene (ygr), which characterizes leaf color. The homozy-gous recessive form (ygr/ygr) produces a pale, yellow-green color. Heterozygous (ygr/YGR) and homozy-gous dominant (YGR/YGR) code for green color leaves. 
You will examine F

Introduction 
The ability to isolate and manipulate genetic material was one of the most powerful changes in the field of biology in the late 20
th
 century. Today, this knowledge of DNA structure and its chemical properties has en-
abled scientists to study, identify, and transform DNA to improve life.   
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
 
One of the first, and most significant, advances in molecular research was the development of the polymer-ase chain reaction technique. 
A
lthough genetic content can be extremely informative, available samples 
are often very small and insufficient for genetic evaluation. To alleviate this concern, a polymerase chain reaction  is often performed to amplify the amount of DNA present. Unlike the cell division performed in the nucleus, PCR can replicate small, or broken fragments of DNA.  PCR can create millions of DNA copies in only a few hours, and requires extremely small amounts of DNA to begin the process. Under ideal conditions, PCR follows an exponential growth pattern. The amount of DNA doubles with every reaction cycle. A PCR setup includes the template DNA sequence desired for am-plification, primers that are complementary to the 5' ends of each DNA strand, free nucleotides, and a ther-mostable polymerase. A description of these components is below: 
 
Template DNA: Acquired from the organism or species of interest. In forensics, for example, a short tandem repeat (STR) is often used for the template DNA. 
 
Primers: Synthesized within a laboratory to match a portion of the template DNA sequence. Two primers are required; one for each strand of the template DNA after it is unwound. The primers ensure that the DNA polymerase attaches to the template DNA in the correct location. 
 
Free Nucleotides: Provide the DNA polymerase with a stock of nucleotides required to copy the template DNA.  
 
Thermostable DNA Polymerase: A DNA polymerase protein typically derived from extremophile bacteria living in thermal springs. This is required to copy the template DNA. Attaches to the pri-mers and recruits the correct free nucleotides to the template DNA until it is fully copied. In PCR,

the polymerase must be stable enough to withstand temperatures capable of unwind-ing DNA without denaturing in structure. 
This mixture is heated to just below boiling temperature to denature the template DNA strands. When this hap-pens, the DNA uncoils and nucleotides are available for copying. It is then cooled to a temperature that facili-tates hydrogen bonding between the primers and the denatured DNA. This step is referred to as annealing. Next, the temperature is raised slightly to allow the DNA polymerase to use primer-DNA hybrids as tem-plates to synthesize and elongate new DNA molecules. The mixture is then heated again to denature the strands and the process starts over. This cycle is typi-cally repeated for 30 - 40 cycles, producing millions or billions of copies of the original DNA target (Figure 1). This procedure has revolutionized molecular biology, genomics, forensics, and diagnostic testing. 
  
DNA Sequencing 
DNA sequencing determines the exact nucleotide se-quence within a DNA fragment. This information is vital to many areas of research. For example, DNA se-quences from different animal species can be com-pared to determine their evolutionary history. Sequenc-ing techniques have changed dramatically over the last 50 years. Historically, these techniques, such as Max-am-Gilbert sequencing, were very time consuming. Technological advances have made DNA sequencing much more efficient while decreasing costs. Next-generation sequencing currently allows for the rapid sequencing of whole genomes. Some might argue that the challenge facing today's researchers is not the data collection, but the data analysis.  
Restriction Enzymes 
DNA must be removed from the cell before it can be used for most types of research. DNA can be isolated from cells with common chemical procedures. Cells can be lysed and DNA separated from other parts based on its solubility. Once DNA is removed from the cell, it is

Biomolecular Techniques 

often fragmented into smaller, more manageable sizes to be analyzed by scientists. This can be achieved with the use of restriction enzymes, which are specialized proteins that cleave DNA. These enzymes are often called restriction endonucleases because they cleave at specific nucleotide sequences within a DNA molecule. Restriction endonucleases can be used to cut DNA into smaller sequences of DNA or even indi-vidual genes. These sequences are usually palindromic.    These enzymes can target different loci to accomplish gene-specific isolations, and can cut or cleave DNA in two different ways. Some restriction endonucleases create blunt ends, and while others create sticky ends. Blunt ends are created when the endonuclease digests both strands of a DNA sequence at the same posi-tion (Figure 2). Sticky ends are created when the enzyme digests each strand at different locations, produc-ing overhangs (Figure 3). These overhanging ends of DNA adhere to each other through hydrogen bonding. DNA ligase can then permanently link the ends together by forming covalent bonds between the phosphate backbones of the DNA 
  
Sticky ends and blunt ends can both be used to further research. For example, scientists can select re-striction endonucleases which create the same type of cut in the donor organism's DNA as well as the recip-ient DNA (sticky ends from donors can bond with sticky ends in the recipient, or vice versa). Creating similar ends helps the donor and the recipient DNA fragments bind together by revealing the appropriate nucleotide sequences. This technique can create a recombinant or genetically engineered DNA.  
Gel Electrophoresis  
Once a sufficient amount of DNA is obtained, a number of different practices can be used to study it. Gel Electrophoresis is a molecular technique that uses an electric current to separate macromolecules (e.g., DNA or proteins) of varying sizes through a permeable gel with pores of a specific size (Figure 4). The gel is a three-dimensional matrix with a chosen porosity and composition which separates the molecules targeted. The gel has a special loading zone, containing wells into which DNA, RNA, or protein samples can be trans-ferred. Loading an electrophoresis gel with the sample requires patience and practice. The sample must be carefully and slowly pipetted into the wells created at the top of the gel. An electric current travels through 
Figure 2:

Blunt ends do not contain any overhanging 
ends. Both blunt and sticky ends can be ligated.

Sticky ends produce overhanging ends from 
palindromic sequences.

the gel, which encourages molecules to migrate through the gel, towards the cathode, at different rates. These rates are largely dependent on the molecular size and charge of the sample. For example, smaller molecules, which can easily fit through the pores in the gel, migrate more quickly than larger molecules which may get physically caught in the gel. Addi-tional factors which affect migration are gel density and the strength of the electric field.   As the sample moves through the gel, components are sepa-rated into bands down the length of the gel. As mentioned, larger molecules will move more slowly through the gel. If the sample has received a dye treatment, the results will appear as distinct bands (Figure 5). These bands can be correlated to a molecular marker (or standard) to determine the molecular weight of the sample in each band. This provides evidence which can lead to the biomolecular identification of each component. Electro-phoresis can be used to compare genomes of different organisms or individuals, as well as to locate and identify a specific gene of interest. 
Recombinant DNA 
DNA can be modified and re-inserted into the original source, or into another organism, if the nucleotide se-quence is available. DNA molecules that are transferred from one organism into another are referred to as recombinant DNA. This technique is very useful and frequently applied in research or when creating hybrid species. For example, many fruit or vegetable crops integrate recombinant DNA to add herbicide resistance or drought tolerance.  
Figure 5: 
http://www.esciencelabs.com/portal/flash_content/Gel_Electrophoresis.swf
A fluorescent dye that binds DNA can be used to visualize DNA bands 
after the gel has been run. Each band indicates a DNA strand of a different length. A molecular marker (or, standard) is noted in both the first and last lane.

Biomolecular Techniques 

Transformation 
Vectors take shape as a variety of things, but plasmids are most commonly used. Plasmids are small, circu-lar, extra-chromosomal, pieces of DNA (2000 - 10,000 base pairs) that are naturally found in bacteria. They became useful molecular biology tools when it was discovered that a foreign gene could be inserted into the plasmid and then transferred into a bacterial cell. This process is called transformation. After the plasmid gets transferred into a bacterial cell (with the foreign DNA sequence) the transformed bacteria can be ex-pected to produce the new gene product(s). The process of transformation is delineated in Figure 6. This technique has enabled huge advances in the fields of molecular biology and genomics.

 254 
Biomolecular Techniques 

 Before a cell can be transformed, it must be conditioned to allow the plasmid (composed of hydrophilic DNA) to cross the cell membrane. This is accomplished by permeablizing the cell membrane, which creates small holes for the DNA to pass through.   Along with transformation, bacteria can also acquire new genetic content through conjugation  and  trans-duction. Conjugation is the transfer of DNA through direct cell-to-cell contact. Transduction is the movement of DNA from one bacterium to another by a virus.  
Antibiotic Resistance  
One way scientists are able to determine if a cell has been successfully transformed is to add an antibiotic resistance gene to the same plasmid that the DNA fragment of interest is inserted into. By culturing cells in antibiotics, scientists can ensure all of the cells that received the plasmid will survive, while the cells which were not transformed with the plasmid will die. Genes which alter the color of the bacterial cell, or even make the cell glow, can also be added to the plasmid to differentiate transformed cells from non-transformed cells. Through an astute understanding of genetics, plasmids, and restriction endonucleases, scientists are able to engineer plasmids to amend the molecular portrait of organisms.

Did You Know... 
 
Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that have not yet generated the struc-tures or proteins characteristic of a specialized cell type. Embryonic stem cells are totipotent, meaning they have the potential to become any type of cell in the body (skin, heart, lung, bone, eye, etc.).   
Adult stem cells, on the other hand, are pluripotent, meaning they are al-ready partially specialized. For example, the stem cells in bone marrow can form blood, bone, cartilage and fat, but not a heart.  Adult stem cells are found in relatively small numbers and are thought to maintain and repair the tissues in which they are found. 
Cll-based therapies induce stem cells to differentiate into the type re-quired to repair damaged or destroyed tissues. The hope is that these cell based therapies will be effective in treating a variety of diseases, such as: heart attack, corneal regeneration, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's dis-ease, multiple sclerosis, some cancers, strokes, diabetes, brain and spinal cord repair, and skin grafts

Experiment 1: DNA Extraction
 
Extraction of DNA from bacteria is a key starting step for many procedures in recombinant DNA technology. A bacterial culture is grown in liquid growth media (from 3 mL for small laboratory preps to over 300 L for in-dustrial applications) then concentrated by spinning the growth in a centrifuge to collect the cells in a pellet. The liquid media is removed and the cells are lysed in a solution containing a detergent (in the lab this is usu-ally sodium dodecyl sulfate, or SDS). This lysis releases all DNA, RNA, and proteins from the cells into the lysis solution. DNA is soluble in water but not in alcohol; therefore, alcohol is added to the solution to force the DNA out of solution. This process is called precipitation. Salt aids in precipitation by neutralizing the neg-atively charged phosphate backbone of DNA and allowing the DNA to stick to itself. In this experiment, you will use fruit as a substitute for bacteria to extract DNA.

1.  Use the 10 mL graduated cylinder to measure and pour approximately five mL of ethanol into a 100 mL 
beaker. Place the beaker in the back of your freezer for approximately 60 minutes. 
2.  In the meantime, obtain a kitchen knife, cutting board, and some fresh, soft fruit. You will need an amount 
which is approximately the same size as five, medium grapes.  
3.  Carefully cut the fruit into small pieces which will be easy to mash in a plastic bag in Step 4. 
4.  Transfer the fruit into a plastic, resealable bag. Seal the bag, and gently mash with your fist until the fruit 
is blended together in one unit. This should be the similar to the consistency of apple sauce, jam, etc.

5.  Rinse the 10 mL graduated cylinder with tap water. Then, measure and pour 10 mL of the DNA extrac-
tion solution into the bag with the fruit in it. Seal the bag completely. Mix well by kneading the bag for ap-
proximately two minutes. 
6.  Fold the cheesecloth until it is approximately three layers thick.  
7.  Create a filter by placing the center of a piece of folded cheesecloth over the mouth of the standing test 
tube, and pushing it down into the tube approximately four to five cm.  
8.  Securing the cheesecloth around the top of the test tube with a rubber band. 
9.  Carefully cut a hole in the bottom corner of the resealable bag and filter the extraction by pouring it into 
the cheesecloth. 
10. Remove and discard the cheesecloth (and any fruit solids trapped in the cloth) after approximately five 
mL of filtered solution have collected in the standing test tube. The filtrate which has passed through the 
cheesecloth, into the standing test tube, should be kept to perform the remainder of the experiment.  
11. Remove the ethanol from the freezer if 60 minutes have passed; if not, wait until the ethanol has been in 
the freezer for 60 minutes and then remove. 
12. Rinse the graduated cylinder again, and transfer the ethanol from the beaker back into the cylinder. You 
may wish to use the funnel to perform this action. 
13. Place the plastic funnel in the standing test tube, and position the standing test tube at a 45&#176; angle.  
14. Slowly pour approximately five mL of ice-cold ethanol into the standing test tube. This will create a layer 
of ethanol on top of the filtered solution. Do not mix the two liquids together. DNA will begin to precipitate 
(come out of solution) after the ethanol has been added to the standing test tube.  
15. Allow the test tube to rest undisturbed for approximately five minutes. You should see air bubbles form at 
the boundary line between the ethanol and the filtered fruit solution. 
DNA float to the top of the ethanol after these bubbles begin to form.  
16. Gently insert the stir rod into the test tube approximately two to four cm. 
Slowly raise and lower the tip several times to spool and collect DNA.  
Note: 
If an insufficient amount of DNA is available, it may not float 
to the top of the solution in a form that can be easily spooled or re-
moved from the test tube. However, the DNA will still be visible as 
white/clear clusters by gently stirring the solution and pushing the 
clusters around the top.

Note:
 
Remember, your DNA strand color scheme may vary, but the pattern should be the same 
as is displayed in Figure 8. For example, Enzyme 1 cuts between 2 blue beads in Table 1, but it 
may correspond to green, red, or yellow beads in your experiment (depending on which colors 
you selected). It does not matter which color you assign to each category, but be sure to keep the 
same pattern used created in Step 1. 
3.  Use colored pencils to draw the fragment sizes in the appropriate cell of Table 1. 
4.  Line up the fragments as they would separate if run through an electrophoresis gel. Use the 
colored pencils to draw them in the appropriate cell of Table 1. 
5.  Repeat this procedure for each enzyme. 
Note: 
The bottom row titled "Enzyme 2 and 3" means that first, Enzyme 2 fragments the 
DNA, then Enzyme 3 cuts the fragments made by Enzyme 2).
 
Post-Lab Questions 
1.  How can DNA be fragmented into very specific sections? 
2.  Where do restriction enzymes come from? What is their function in nature? 
3.  How do molecules of varying sizes separate in electrophoresis? What is the purpose of the gel? What 
about the electricity? 
4.  Investigate one way in which electrophoresis is used in medicine today. Write one or two par-
agraphs to explain your findings.

Experiment 3: Cloning a DNA Fragment to a Bacterially-Derived Plasmid Vector 
Bacteria frequently contain extrachromosomal plasmids, which are circular DNA genetic elements that are self-replicating. Plasmids are typically not necessary for the bacteria's survival but can sometimes confer a growth advantage to the bacteria. Plasmids can be transferred between bacteria and recombinant DNA technology makes use of this feature to introduce "foreign" genes into bacteria and use the bacteria as a cell "factory" to produce the gene. Genes are inserted into plasmids (also called vectors) by means of restriction enzymes. As mentioned earlier, restriction enzymes are bacterially derived enzymes that recognize specific DNA sequences and cut (or restrict) that particular DNA sequence in a consistent way. Any DNA that con-tains a particular restriction enzyme sequence will be cut in the same way. In this experiment, you will be given two sequences of DNA: one sequence is a foreign gene and the other sequence is of a plasmid vec-tor. You will use a computer program to identify where the common restriction sites for both sequences oc-cur. Scientists perform this type of computer simulation prior to performing restriction enzyme digestion to ensure that they will cut the sequences as expected.

Experiment 4: Gel Electrophoresis 
In this lab, you will prepare an agarose gel and use an electric current to separate dyes of different molecular weights and charges. You will also have to analyze two dyes of unknown composition and determine what mixture they are based on results from your known samples.  
Note:
 
Gels must be analyzed immediately after electrophoresis. Color bands will diffuse and bleed over time. 
 Procedure 
1.  To prepare the agarose, put on your safety glasses, and loosen or unscrew the cap on the agarose con-
tainer and place it in a microwave or hot water bath. If using a microwave, turn the microwave on normal heat for approximately 30 seconds. Monitor the bottle very closely, and remove it from heat every 5 - 10 seconds to swirl/mix the contents. If using a hot water bath, be sure that the water does not cover the bottle or mix with the agarose inside. 
Note: 
Agarose becomes very hot, very quickly. It is extremely important to watch the container very 
closely to prevent unintentional boiling over or agarose explosions. Do not touch the container imme-diately after heating; instead, make sure the container has cooled and always use a hot pad or towel when removing the bottle from the heat source. 
2.  Remove the container from heat. Allow it to cool to a safe handling temperature (it should still feel warm 
but not hot to the touch; approximately 60 &#176;C). Be cautious, and use a hot pad or towel to protect your hands.  
3.  Insert the six toothed comb into the slots of the gel box before you pour the agarose into the trough. The 
comb causes the 0.8% agarose to mold around the teeth and create wells after the gel has cooled and solidified.

Biomolecular Techniques 

4.  Carefully pour 12 mL of the viscous agarose into the central trough of the gel electrophoresis chamber. 
Be careful not to pour too much agarose into the chamber! The agarose height should not surpass the height of the short, plastic walls located on both ends of the chamber. 
Hint:
 
The trough walls are easiest to view from the side. They are positioned approximately 
1
/
4
 in from 
the top and bottom ends of the chamber. It may help to be eye level with the chamber when pouring the agarose. When looking straight on, from a lateral view, you can easily view the height of the walls and identify when to stop when pouring the agarose. 
5.  While the agarose is still liquid, it is important to remove any air bubbles that may have been introduced 
while pouring. Use a pipette tip to "poke" any bubbles or move them to the side. 
6.  Allow the agarose to rest undisturbed until it has solidified. This should take approximately 10 - 15 
minutes. The agarose will have a Jello
&#233;
-like firmness when it is ready. 
7.  Use the 100 mL graduated cylinder to measure 
and pour approximately 20 mL of 1X TBE buffer into the chamber. This will completely submerge the agarose. See Figure 9 for reference. 
8.  Carefully remove the comb. You may have to soft-
ly jiggle the comb out of the gel. but try to pull the comb out by simultaneously applying an equal, upward force on the right and left sides of the comb. It  may help to  rest the sides of your hands of the edges of the chamber and press down  while pulling the comb up.  Do not break the gel bed. If the gel bed does break, it can be re-heated and pour again.  
9.  You should now see six wells in the agarose. This 
is where you will pipette the samples. Place a dark piece of paper under the gel chamber if you are having difficulties viewing the wells.  
10. Cut two, four by four cm pieces out of the carbon 
fabric. One piece is for the top end of the chamber and one is for the bottom end. The top end is the end located closest to the six wells in the agarose, and the bottom end is located farthest from the wells.  
11. Fold the carbon fabric pieces in half so that they are two layers thick. Fasten one piece over each end of 
the trough by clamping one alligator clip over the fabric at the top, and another alligator clip over the fab-ric at the bottom. The alligator clips should not be connected to the battery yet. 
12. Load the dye samples from left to right following the order: Pyronin, Methyl Orange, Ponceau G, Xylene 
Cyanol, Unknown #1, and Unknown #2. To load the dyes, perform the following steps. 
A.  Use the micro-tip pipette to pick up approximately 20 &#956;l of pyronin. This should fill the narrow, bot-
tom portion of the pipette. Do not stop squeezing the bulb as this will cause the dye to travel up the shaft of the pipette and may aspirate the sample.  
B.  Expel any air located in the tip of the pipette so that it is not introduced into the well. Remove ex-
TBE

The TBE Buffer should completely cover the

cess dye off the outside of the pipette so as to not introduce any dye into the TBE solution. 
C.  Submerge the tip into the buffer, 
targeting the desired well, and slowly dispense the dye sample into the well by gently squeez-ing the bulb on the pipette. Keep the bulb firmly squeezed until the pipette is completely removed from the TBE buffer to avoid sucking any TBE or dye back into the pipette. See Fig-ure 10 for reference. 
D. Repeat this process for each 
dye sample, including the two unknown dye solutions. Remember to use a clean micro-tip pipette and a new well for each sam-ple! 
Note:
 
The dyes have been mixed with a sucrose solution to increase their density and ensure 
your sample will fall gently into the well. However, it is still important to apply the electric cur-rent relatively quickly after pipetting the samples to avoid allowing the dyes to diffuse out of their respective wells. 
13. Attach the loose end of the top alligator clip to the 
negative  terminal on the 9 V battery. Then, attach the loose end of the bottom alligator clip to the positive  terminal on the 9 V battery, as shown in Figure 11. 
14. Observe the gel electrophoresis apparatus careful-
ly. At minimum, monitor the dye movement once an hour for approximately five hours. 
15. Once separation of the dyes has been achieved, 
disconnect the clips from the battery to discontinue the electrical current.  
16. Use a ruler to measure the distance from the wells 
to the center of the bands for each dye. Record the data in Table 3. Be sure to include units. 
17. If more than one band per dye is visible on the aga-
rose bed, record the number of bands in Table 3. 
    
Figure 11: 
 
The black clip is at the top, and is at-
tached to the negative (-) terminal. The red clip is at the bottom, and is attached to the positive (+) termi-nal. The colors provided in your lab kit may deviate from black and red.
 
Figure 10: 
When loading the samples, try not to squeeze an air 
bubble into the well. This will make the dye come out of the well.

Introduction

Photosynthesis is the process by which most plants, certain bacteria, and some algae harness light energy <span style="word-spacing:7.5px">and manufacture food. In other words, it uses solar energy (light) to produce chemical energy</span> (carbohydrates). Photosynthesis consumes carbon dioxide (CO
2
, a greenhouse gas) and releases oxygen
 
(O
2
) (Figure 1). Nearly all life on Earth relies on this reaction in some format. Although there are many vari-
ants of photosynthesis found throughout nature, one of the most common products formed through photo-synthesis is a sugar molecule called glucose (C

H

).  
All photosynthetic reactions are either light-dependent or light-independent. Both types occur in special-<span style="word-spacing:1px;">ized organelles called chloroplasts in eukaryotes (plants and some algae species). The proteins involved </span><span style="word-spacing:1px;">in photosynthesis in photosynthetic bacteria are located in the cell membrane of these prokaryotes. Chlo-</span><span style="word-spacing:2.3px;">roplasts, similar to that of mitochondria, are thought to have originated through an endosymbiotic event. </span>

Plant Pigments and Photosynthesis 
That is, at some point in eukaryotic evolution, photosynthesizing bacteria (specifically cyanobacteria) were <span style="word-spacing:1px;">engulfed and became permanently associated with the eukaryote. In fact, chloroplasts maintain their own, </span>unique circular double stranded DNA.   A chloroplast has four principal structures that play a role in photosynthesis (Figure 2):   
1.  Thylakoids: Small disk-shaped structures. These contain a pigment called chlorophyll which cap-
tures light energy. 
2.  Grana: Stacks of connected thylakoids. 3.  Lamellas: Structures that link grana together. 4.  Stroma: <span style="word-spacing:0.6px;">The fluid within the chloroplast, similar to cytoplasm. This fluid surrounds the grana and </span>
contains the liquids and molecules required for the Calvin Cycle. Chloroplast DNA and ribosomes are also located within the stroma. 
 
Plant Pigments 
Plants have a number of different pigments which give plants their color and absorb light. Chlorophylls  and carotenoids  <span style="word-spacing:2.2px;">are two important classes of pigments. Chlorophylls are the greenish pigments and include </span><span style="word-spacing:0.2px;">several kinds. Chlorophyll A is found in all photosynthesizing plants, algae and cyanobacteria. Chlorophyll B </span>and chlorophyll C are less widespread and are only found in certain groups of organisms.  
Figure 2: 
Chlorophyll gives plants their green color. Wheat grass juice, common in health food stores, 
has a pronounced dark green color due to its high chlorophyll content.

Plant Pigments and Photosynthesis 
Carotenoids include the red, orange and yellow pigments. Carotenoids are sometimes referred to as acces-sory pigments because they pass the absorbed energy to chlorophyll when they absorb sunlight. Hundreds  of known carotenoids are categorized into two major divisions: carotenes and xanthophylls. Beta carotene is  the most abundant carotene in plants. This orange pigment gives carrots their color. Xanthophyll are yellow  pigments and, similar to carotenes, are found in the leaves of most green plants.   
 
Oxidation-Reduction Reactions (Review) 
<span>Oxidation-reduction reactions, commonly referred to as redox reactions, are involved in photosynthesis. Re- dox reactions always include two separate reactions: an oxidation reaction and a reduction reaction. These  reactions are so intricately connected that each oxidation and reduction reaction is often considered a half- reaction. Electrons are lost in oxidation reactions, and the same electrons are gained in the associated re- duction reaction as the molecule transitions from the reactant to the product. When a molecule or atom un- dergoes oxidation, it is said to have been oxidized. Oxidizing agents are responsible for oxidation.  Once the  electrons are lost, the molecule is considered a cation. Cations are molecular ions which have a positive  charge.  </span>  A  reduction  <span>reaction is one in which a molecule gains electrons as it transitions from the reactant to the  product. Once the electrons are gained, the molecule is considered an anion. When a molecule or atom un- dergoes reduction, it is said to have been reduced. Reducing agents are responsible for reduction. Anions  are molecular ions which have a negative charge.     </span>
Light-Dependent Reactions 
Light-dependent reactions take place in chlorophyll A, chlorophyll B, and ca- rotenoid pigments. Electrons act as the energy carrier throughout these re- actions. Operating in tandem with other pigments, chlorophyll breaks the  chemical bond of water and releases hydrogen and oxygen. These products,  along with carbon dioxide undergo additional modifications in the stroma  during the light-independent reaction stage (also known as the Calvin- Benson Cycle). This ultimately results in the production of glucose, which  can then be used for energy. 
  
Photosynthesis: White Light and Green Light
 
White light is a form of solar energy that contains all the wavelengths in the  spectrum (i.e. "colors": blue, green, yellow, etc.). Each pigment in a plant  absorbs specific wavelengths of light, with most plants being unable to ab- sorb green wavelengths. These are reflected back, which is why plants typi- cally appear green. All of the other wavelengths (colors) are absorbed by the  plant and initiate the formation of chemical energy. Figure 3 illustrates how  each pigment absorbs specific wavelengths. Remember, color corresponds  with the wavelength.

Did You Know... 
 
Most of us have heard of the  circadian cycles that humans  engage in during sleep. But  most people don't know that  circadian cycles also affect  plant species to help them  sense ambient light levels.  This cycle is regulated by os- cillating biochemical process- es which promote or inhibit  the production of proteins  involved in photosynthesis.  This regulation is critical to a  plant's ability to maintain its  base anabolic actions which  rely on solar energy.

Plant Pigments and Photosynthesis 
Light-Independent Reactions (The Calvin-Benson Cycle): 
After the light-dependent reaction, the light-independent reaction takes resultant products and converts  them to carbohydrates and oxygen in a process known as the Calvin-Benson Cycle (Figure 4). The Calvin- Benson Cycle is composed of multiple reactions that link carbon atoms to form simple sugar molecules such  as glucose. This cycle begins when the enzyme RuBisCO (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/ oxygenase) acquires carbon from the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. Carbon fixation, reduction,  and regeneration of ribulose then proceed to complete the Calvin-Benson Cycle.   
Chromatography 
Chromatography  is a set of techniques  that can physically separate components of a mixture allowing for  purification and analysis of these components. There are many methods to utilize this principle, but they all  have a stationary phase and a mobile phase. The mobile phase includes a complex mixture of individual  components, called analytes, and an eluting solvent. The stationary phase is added to the mobile phase, and  analytes migrate along an adsorptive material at different rates. The physical and chemical properties of  each analyte affect the rate of migration. For example, analytes with low solubility will migrate a shorter dis- tance than analytes with higher solubility. These different rates, consequently, separate the analytes. In pa- per chromatography, the analytes are separated along a piece of chromatography paper.

Paper chromatography is used to separate analytes, such as plant pigments, along a piece of chromatog- raphy paper. When the end of a piece of paper is dipped into water, the water molecules find new molecules  to bond. The water molecules climb up the paper being replaced by new water molecules below. Solutes,  which might be dissolved in the water, will also be carried along up the paper. The different solutes are car- ried along at different rates because they are not equally soluble. They are also differentially attracted to the  fibers of the paper through the formation of intermolecular bonds, such as hydrogen bonds. Plant pigments  can be separated by paper chromatography. After running the chromatogram, a retention factor     (R
f
 factor) 
</content>

Plant Pigments and Photosynthesis 
can be calculated for each analyte. The R
f
 is a ratio of the distance the analytes travel relative to the distance 
the eluting solvent travels.  <span>The different pigments found in plants can be separated using paper chromatography. Beta carotene is able  to travel relatively far up the paper because the pigment does not form any hydrogen bonds with the paper.  Xanthophyll, on the other hand, contains an oxygen group which forms hydrogen bonds with the paper.  Therefore, this pigment will be seen lower than beta carotene. Chlorophyll contains both oxygen and nitro- gen, which bind even stronger to the paper and will travel even less than xanthophyll when separated with  paper chromatography.</span> 
You will be using pH indicators to detect carbon fixation, or the depletion of carbon dioxide, during the pro- ceeding lab experiments. The concentration of carbon dioxide molecules decreases as carbon dioxide is re- duced and oxygen is released. This causes the environmental pH to rise and the solution to become more  basic.

Pre-Lab Questions 
1.  Describe how the functional units for beta carotene, xanthophyll, chlorophyll A, and chlorophyll B are dif-
ferent. Be sure to identify the subunits that adhere to paper during chromatography. 
2.  Describe a technique for measuring photosynthetic rate. 
3.  Many deciduous trees have leaves which turn yellow in the fall. What do you suppose is happening in the 
leaves at the cellular and molecular level? 
4.  We have seen that chloroplasts are the organelles in plant cells that provide energy to the cell. The 
equivalent organelle in eukaryotic (animal) cells is the mitochondria. Both are also unusual in that they have double membranes and contain their own set of DNA. Can you think of any explanations for this observation?

Plant Pigments and Photosynthesis 
Experiment 1: Paper Chromatography
 
In this laboratory, you will separate plant pigments using chromatography. You will also measure the rate of photosynthesis in isolated chloroplasts using the reduction of the dye 2,6-Dichloroindophenol (DPIP) as the measurement tool. The transfer of electrons during photosynthesis reduces DPIP, changing it from blue to clear. This color can be quantitatively measured with a spectrophotometer, but you will qualitatively analyze your data. 
Procedure 
Part 1: Paper Chromatography 
1.  Place the bottle containing 100 mL of sucrose solution in the refrigerator. Allow the solution to rest here 
for the remainder of Part 1; it will be required in Part 2. 
2.  Use the permanent market to label each 100 mL beaker as 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
3.  Add 10 mL water to Beaker 1, 10 mL acetone to Beaker 2, 10 mL mineral oil to Beaker 3, and 10 mL ace-
tic acid to Beaker 4. Cover the beakers with aluminum foil, and set them aside. 
4.  Use a pencil to draw a line approximately one cm from the bottom (across the bottom edge) of each piece 
of chromatography paper. Then, carefully cut each piece in half so that you have four, pieces of identical

5.  Use a quarter to extract pigment from a fresh spinach leaf by placing the leaf in between the filter pa-
per and the coin. Firmly rub the edge of the quarter back and forth over the pencil line drawn in Step 2. 
Use a fresh section of the leaf for each rubbing (Figure 5). 
6.  Place one piece of filter paper in Beaker 1, with the pigment-side towards the bottom of the beaker. 
Tape the filter paper to the beaker so that the bottom of the filter paper is submerged in the solvent, 
but the pigment line is not. 
DO NOT ALLOW THE PIGMENT TO TOUCH THE SOLVENT!
 
7.  Monitor the set-up as the solvent travels up the paper. Remove the paper when the solvent is about 
one cm from the top of the paper. Immediately mark the solvent front and the location of each analyte 
band. 
8.  Measure the distance from the original pencil line to the solvent front, and the original pencil line to 
each of the pigments. Record the data in Table 1.  
9.  Calculate the R
f
 using the following equation: 
10. Repeat Steps 6 - 9 for Beakers 2, 3, and 4. Be sure to use a new piece of filter paper for each beaker.  
Part 2: Chloroplast Isolation and Wet Mount Preparation (Optional) 
10. Obtain a knife and cutting board. Carefully cut across a few spinach leaves to isolate chloroplasts from 
the leaves. 
11. Place the leaves in a resealable bag. Measure and pour 100 mL of the cold sucrose solution (prepared 
in Part 1: Step 1) into the resealable bag with the spinach leaves. 
12. Remove any air from the plastic bag and seal completely. Mash the solution two minutes.

13. Lay a piece of cheesecloth over a 250 mL beaker, and push the cheesecloth into the test tube approxi-
mately four to five cm with your finger. Secure with a rubber band. 
14. Slowly pour the spinach/sucrose solution into the cheesecloth. Allow the cheesecloth to filter the solu-
tion for several minutes; or, until all of the liquid has passed through the cheesecloth.  
15. Once the liquid has drained, discard the collected solids. You may wish to squeeze the cheesecloth to 
extract any remaining liquid before throwing it away if liquid appears to be caught. 
16. Prepare a wet mount slide with the filtered liquid (see Lab 4: Introduction to the Microscope if you need 
additional instructions) of the isolated chloroplasts and examine your extract. Do not discard the re-
maining liquid; it is required for Part 3.  
 
Part 3: Photosynthesis 
17. Use the permanent marker to label four test tubes as 1, 2, 
and 3. Place the tubes in the test tube rack. 
18. Add three mL water, one mL phosphate buffer, and one 
mL DPIP to each of the three test tubes. 
19. Add two drops of freshly swirled chloroplast solution 
(prepared in Part 2) to Tubes 2 and 3. Keep the remaining 
liquid for the next experiment. 
20. Immediately cover Tube 2 with aluminum foil. 
21. Place Tube 1 and Tube 3 in a sunny location or under a 
strong light. If you place the tubes in front of a light, fill a 
beaker or clear glass with water and position in between 
the light source and the test tubes as shown in Figure 6. 
22. Monitor the test tubes for several hours, and record how long it takes each tube to turn from blue to 
clear. After the tubes exposed to light turn clear, remove the aluminum foil from Tube 2 and immediate-
ly note the color. Record your data in Table 2.

Post-Lab Questions 
1.  What did the different colored bands signify in each solvent for Part 1? What pigments can you associate 
them with? 
2.  What is the osmolarity fluid used in Part 2? Why is this important? Why is it essential to keep it cool? 
3.  How could you modify this experiment to show the effects of different wavelengths of light on the photo-
synthetic rate? 
4.  Some plants (grasses) tend to contain a greater concentration of chlorophyll than others (pines). Can you 
develop a hypothesis to explain this? Would it be testable?

Experiment 2: Measuring the Rate of Photosynthesis
 
Photosynthesis is dependent on light for energy. However, only certain light wavelengths are suitable for this process. Wavelengths which are too short possess high energy which can easily destroy vital biomolecules such as DNA and essential proteins. Wavelengths which are too long possess low energy which may not be energetic enough to power photosynthesis.   When wavelengths which carry the correct amount of energy are absorbed by plant pigment, the electrons <span style="word-spacing: -1px;">inside absorb that energy are move up to higher energy levels. Photosynthesis is thus engaged and ATP and </span>NADPH are produced.  <span style="word-spacing: 1.8px;">In this experiment, you will use plant leaf disks to view the net photosynthetic rate of the plant pigments. </span><span style="word-spacing: -0.4px;">When a normal air-based environment is infiltrated with a new solution, the density of the leaf disks increas-</span><span style="word-spacing: 0.5px;;">es and they sink to the bottom of the solution. However, as photosynthesis proceeds, oxygen is produced, </span>the density decreases, and the leaf disks rise again.  
The final process involved in this experiment reviews cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is a separate  process which occurs outside of photosynthesis. Respiration consumes oxygen. This will decrease the oxy- gen concentration, resulting in an increased density of the leaf disks. Thus, the overall migration of the leaf  disks through the solution can be used to measure the net photosynthetic rate.

Plant Pigments and Photosynthesis 
Procedure: 
Part A: 
1.  Use a permanent marker to label two plastic cups as "CO
2
, 30 cm Light" and "Soapy Water, 30 cm 
Light". Leave the remaining cups unlabeled and set aside. Label the 600 mL beaker as "1", and the 250 
mL beaker as "2". 
2.  Use a measuring spoon to measure 
1
/
4
 tsp. of sodium bicarbonate and transfer it into Beaker 1. 
3.  Fill Beaker 1 approximately 599 mL of water. Stir to mix. 
4.  Pour approximately two to three mL (approximately one squirt!) of dishwashing soap into Beaker 2. 
5.  Fill Beaker 2 with 200 mL of water. Gently stir to mix; avoid creating soap suds. 
6.  Use a pipette to transfer approximately one drop of the solution from Beaker 2 into Beaker 1. Again, 
avoid creating soap suds.  
Note: 
It is critical not to create suds during this step. If suds are created, add a small amount of sodi-
um bicarbonate or water to Beaker 1 to dilute the soap. 
7.  Pour the solution from Beaker 1 into the plastic cups labeled "CO
2
, 30 cm Light" until there is approxi-
mately three cm of solution in the cup. Pour the solution from Beaker 2 into the cup labeled "Soapy Wa-
ter, 30 cm Light" until there is approximately three cm of solution in the cup.  
8.  Use the 1-hole punch to punch out 40 leaf disks. Try to avoid punching through any major veins in the 
leaves. Separate these disks into four piles of 10 disks. 
Note: 
It is advisable to punch out extra leaf disks should you need to repeat part of the procedure. 
9.  Pull the piston out of the syringe and transfer 10 leaf disks into the bottom of the syringe.

10. Replace the piston in the syringe and push it down until there is only a small amount of air remaining in 
the syringe (less than 10% of the total syringe volume). Be careful not to smash the leaf disks.  
11. Place the bottom/tip of the syringe into Beaker 1. Pull up on the piston to transfer a small volume of the 
sodium bicarbonate/soap solution into the syringe. Take the syringe out of Beaker 1 and place your finger 
on the open tip of the syringe. 
12. Rotate the syringe so that the tip is facing up, and the piston handle is directed towards the ground. Use 
your finger to gently tap the syringe near the leaf disks to move the leaf disks into solution.  
13. Keeping your finger on the syringe tip, pull back on the piston to create a vacuum environment within the 
syringe. Hold this vacuum in place for approximately 10 seconds, continuously swirling the syringe barrel 
to further encourage the leaf disks into suspension. The leaves should move away from the tip and to-
wards the rubber end of the piston during this step. 
14. Remove your finger from the syringe tip. If all of the leaf disks are suspended in 
the solution, proceed to Step 15. If some disks still remain near the syringe tip (at 
the top of the solution) repeat Steps 11 - 13. See Figure 7 for reference.  
Note: 
If the disks do not suspend in the solution after three attempts of Steps 
11 - 13, add a few more drops of the soapy water from Beaker 2 to Beaker 1 
and repeat Steps 9 - 14. Repeating the vacuum procedure more than three 
times will damage the leaf disks! 
15. Remove the piston from the syringe to pour the solution and disks from the sy-
ringe into the cup labeled "CO
2
, 30 cm Light". Position the plastic cup approxi-
mately 30 cm below a light source and begin timing. 
16. Record the number of floating disks in one minute intervals in a clear, logical for-
mat in Table 3. Be sure to indicate the time interval and trial to which each meas-
urement corresponds. Continue timing until all leaves have floated to the top of 
the solution (approximately 15 minutes). 
Note: 
It is important to closely observe the leaf disks to ensure that none of them become stuck to 
each other or to the plastic cup. If any disks become stuck, gently swirl the cup or use a pipette to dis-
turb and separate them.  
17. Indicate whether this part of the experiment, Part A, demonstrates a positive control or a negative control 
in Table 3.  
  
Part B 
18. Empty the syringe contents and repeat Steps 9 - 10.

19. Place the bottom/tip of the syringe into Beaker 2. Pull up on the piston to transfer a small volume of the 
soap solution into the syringe. Remove the syringe from Beaker 2 and place your finger on the open tip 
of the syringe. 
20. Rotate the syringe so that the tip is facing up, and the piston handle is facing down towards the ground. 
Gently tap the syringe near the leaf disks to encourage the leaf disks into solution.  
21. Keeping your finger on the syringe tip, pull back on the piston to create a vacuum environment within the 
syringe. Hold this vacuum in place for approximately 10 seconds, swirling the syringe barrel to further 
encourage the leaf disks into suspension. The leaves should move away from the tip and towards the 
rubber end of the piston during this step. 
22. Remove your finger from the syringe tip. If all of the disks are suspended in the solution, proceed to Step 
23. If some disks still remain near the syringe tip (at the top of the solution) repeat Steps 20 - 22.  
Note: 
If the disks do not suspend in the solution after three attempts, repeat Steps 29 - 22 with new 
leaf disks. Repeating the vacuum procedure more than 3 times will damage the leaf disks! 
23. Remove the piston from the syringe to pour the solution and disks from the syringe into the cup labeled 
"Soapy Water, 30 cm Light". Position the plastic cup approximately 30 cm below a light source and begin 
timing. 
24. Record the number of floating disks in one minute intervals and record your results in Table 3. Continue 
timing for approximately 15 minutes. 
Note: 
It is important to closely observe the leaf disks to ensure that none of them become stuck to 
each other or to the plastic cup. If any disks become stuck, gently swirl the cup or use a pipette to 
disturb and separate them.

25. Select a new environmental variable in which to test the photosynthetic rate. Label one of the remaining 
cups with the variable you select (example, if you select a dark environment, label the cup as "CO

26. Construct a hypothesis in the Data section at the end of this procedure. This should indicate how you ex-
pect the variable to impact photosynthetic rate, and why.  
27. Repeat Steps 9 - 16, using the newly labeled plastic cup instead of the "CO
2
, 30 cm Light" cup. Position 
the plastic cup in the new environment and begin timing. Record your data in Table 3.

Introduction 
What is science? You have likely taken several classes throughout your career as a student, and know that it is more than just chapters in a book. Science is a process. It uses evidence to understand the history of the natural world and how it works. Scientific knowledge is constantly evolving as we understand more about the natural world. Furthermore, the constant development of equipment and techniques allows us to gain an in-creasingly deeper insight into the natural world. Science begins with observations that can be measured in some way, and often concludes with observations from analyzed data.  Following the scientific method helps to minimize bias when testing a theory. It helps scientists collect and organize information in a useful way so that patterns and data can be analyzed in a meaningful way. As a sci-entist, you should use the scientific method as you conduct the experiments throughout this manual.

Introduction 
Plants are multi-cellular, eukaryotes. They require energy and nutrients to engage in vital cell processes.  However, unlike animals which have a heart and blood to circulate critical elements, vascular plants must  rely on their roots to uptake water and minerals from soil, and a specialized circulatory system to transport  the nutrients to all other parts of the plant. This system is composed of xylem and phloem (Figure 1).    
Xylem and Phloem 
Xylem  are hollow vessels produced from dead cells. They have additional support in their cell walls, which  allows them to withstand the heavy weight imposed by the overall plant structure. Water and nutrients are  transported from roots to leaves through the xylem conduits. Phloem are composed of living cells which form  long, sieve-like tubes to transport the carbohydrate products of photosynthesis from the leaves to the rest of  the plant. This process is called translocation. The vascular system allows plants to grow in diverse cli- mates and to an extreme size. For example, Sequoia trees can live up to 2,200 years and grow to a height of  379 feet! That's longer than a football field!

Plant Transpiration 
Transpiration
 
Water moves up the xylem, against the force of gravity. Water which reaches the surface of the leaves  through the xylem may then evaporate and diffuse out of the stomata  into the atmosphere in a process  called transpiration. Stomata are small pore like objects which regulate the flow of water by opening to re- lease water into the atmosphere through evaporation. There are millions of stomata in a single plant leaf.  When water evaporates, additional water and nutrients must be withdrawn from the ground to replace the  water which has been lost. This process begins when water is absorbed by root cells and flows up the stem  to the leaves and flowers, where it is allowed to escape (Figure 2). In this way, a continuous process of  "drinking" water from the soil and evaporation takes place.

Plant Transpiration 
Transpiration Rate 
A few key factors contribute to transpiration rate. These factors include humidity, light, temperature, and  wind. Humidity is inversely related to transpiration rate; in other words, increased humidity decreases the rate  of transpiration. Light, temperature, and wind are all directly related to transpiration rate. For example, bright,  windy, and high temperature conditions may all increase the transpiration rate.   
Chemical and Physical Properties of Water
 
The chemical formula of water is recognized as H
2
O. Looking at 
the chemistry of the molecule, you can see that two hydrogen  atoms are bound to one oxygen atom (Figure 4). However,  the  hydrogen atoms do not bind equidistant from each other. In- stead, two hydrogen atoms bond to the same side of the oxygen  atom, creating molecular polarity. In other words, there is a posi- tive charge on one side of the molecule, and a negative charge  on the other. Since opposite charges attract, water molecules  are attracted to other water molecules. In this form, or as a solid (ice), or gas (water vapor), water serves a great many purposes in the Earth's atmosphere.

Due to the cohesive nature of water (polarity), as a water molecule leaves the plant, another takes its place. The surface tension among the water molecules in the xylem, all the way down to the roots, ensures that as one molecule is lost to evaporation another replaces it in the roots. Think of sucking on a straw, as you suck liquid at the top, it is replaced by liquid at the bottom.

Plant Transpiration 
Non-vascular plants (bryophytes) do not have a specialized circulatory system and are growth-restricted  based on the availability of water. These low-growing plants, such as moss and liverwort species, usually  thrive in dark, damp habitats where they can absorb water from their surface. Although they lack vascular  tissues, true roots, leaves, and stems, they can transport water internally. Like sponges, they must imbibe  the water needed for survival from their surrounding atmosphere through processes such as diffusion and  capillary action. However, due to their limited terrestrial habitats, non-vascular plants have never dominated  much of the Earth's terrain.

Introduction to Science 
The process of the scientific method begins with an observation. For example, suppose you observe a plant growing towards a window. This observation could be the first step in designing an experiment. Remember that observations are used to begin the scientific method, but they may also be used to help analyze data.   Observations can be quantitative (measurable), or qualitative (immeasurable; observational). Quantitative observations allow us to record findings as data, and leave little room for subjective error. Qualitative obser-vations cannot be measured. Instead, they rely on human sensory perceptions. The nature of these observa-tions makes them more subjective and susceptible to human error. However, qualitative observations are still able to provide useful information, as discussed below.  Suppose you have a handful of pennies. You can make quantitative observations that there are 15 pennies, and each is 1.9 cm in diameter. Both the quantity, and the diameter, can be precisely measured. You can al-so make qualitative observations that they are brown, shiny, or smooth. The color and texture are not numeri-cally measured, and may vary based on the individual's perception or background.    Quantitative observations are generally preferred in science because they involve &#34;hard&#34; data. Because of this, many scientific instruments, such as microscopes and scales, have been developed to alleviate the need for qualitative observations. Rather than observing that an object is large, we can now identify specific mass, shapes, structures, etc.   There are still many situations, as you will encounter throughout this lab manual, in which qualitative observa-tions are useful. Noticing the color change of a leaf or the change in smell of a compound, for example, are important observations and can provide a great deal of practical information.  
Developing a Hypothesis 
Once an observation has been made, the next step is to develop a hy-pothesis. A hypothesis is a statement describing what the scientist thinks will happen in the experiment. A hypothesis is a proposed explana-tion for an event based on observation(s).  A null hypothesis is a testable statement that if proven true, means the hypothesis was incorrect.  Both a hypothesis and a null hypothesis statement must be testable, but only one can be true. Hypotheses are typically written in an if/then format. For example:  
Hypothesis:  
If plants are grown in soil with added nutrients, then they will grow faster than plants grown without added nutrients. 
 Null hypothesis: 
If plants are grown in soil with added nutrients, then they will grow at the same rate as plants grown in soil without nutrients.

Plant Transpiration 
 
Post-Lab Questions  
1.  How far did the dye travel in the celery which was submerged in water for 15 minutes? How far did it 
travel in the piece which was air-dried for 15 minutes?  
2.  In which celery stalk was the water column broken? 
  
Experiment 2: Water Movement in Flowers  
Carnations colored green for St. Patrick's Day or blue for the Fourth of July profit from transpiration to intro-duce color to the flowers. In this experiment, you will create your own colored carnation to gain a better un-derstanding of how water travels through a plant. 
Procedure  
1.  Fill a beaker with 50 mL water. Add 8 - 10 drops of the red dye. Under running water, cut the stem so 
that only one cm is left beneath the flower head. If this step is not performed under water, air bubbles 
can enter the xylem and prevent water from traveling to the flower. 
2.  Float the flower in the dye solution so that the fresh/exposed portion of the cut stem remains under wa-
ter. 
3.  Set the beaker containing the flower in an illuminated place for 24 - 48 hours (depending on light intensi-
ty). Observe the flower, and answer the Post-Lab Questions.

Post-Lab Questions 
 
1.  In which part of the flower is the dye located? How did it get there? 
2.  What factors can influence the rate of transpiration in flowers? 
  
Experiment 3: Transpiration 
Plants use transpiration to deliver water to its highest leaves, sometimes hundreds of feet above the roots. In this lab, you will demonstrate transpiration using a semi-permeable membrane to represent stomata and a fan to increase evaporation rate. 
Procedure  
1.  Use the permanent marker to label two test tubes as 1 and 2.  
2.  Fill each 100 mL beakers with 100 mL water. Place each 15 cm piece of dialysis tubing in a beaker. 
Soak the dialysis tubing for approximately five minutes. 
3.  Rub the dialysis tubing pieces between your forefinger and thumb to open up the tubing (this action is 
similar to the way one opens a plastic bag in the produce section at the grocery store).

4.  Seal one end of each of the dialysis tubing piece by wrapping a small rubber band around the bottom . 
Make sure the bands are wrapped very tightly to create a water-proof seal. Use different colored bands to 
keep track of the different bags. 
5.  Place the small funnel in one of the dialysis tubing pieces. Use the measuring spoon to carefully transfer 
two teaspoons of sodium polyacrylate into the dialysis tubing.  
6.  Repeat Step 5 for the second piece of dialysis tubing. 
7.  Tie the open ends of each dialysis tube with two 
more small rubber bands. Set the tubing aside. 
8.  Completely fill the 250 mL beaker with 250 mL wa-
ter. 
9.  Submerge each of the dialysis tubing pieces in the 
250 mL beaker. Allow the tubing to remain under-
water for approximately 30 minutes to fully saturate 
the sodium polyacrylate.  
10. Place the test tubes in the test tube rack. Then, use 
the 100 mL graduated cylinder to measure and 
pour 23 mL water into each test tube. 
11. Place one piece of dialysis tubing in each test tube. 
The tubing should be partially in the water, and par-
tially above the rim of the test tube. If the tubing 
does not support itself, place it back in the beaker 
of water for 5 - 10 minutes. Observe the tubing care-
fully to ensure that the bag does not open, and evaluate the size  of the tubing (Figure 11). 
12. Support the fan by first emptying one of the 100 mL beakers. Turn the beaker upside down, and place the 
fan on top so that the fan blades are facing one of the test tubes. Note the rubber band color of the test 
tube towards which the fan is directed.  
13. Turn on the fan and allow it to run for approximately two hours. 
14. After two hours, remove the dialysis tubing from the test tubes. Measure the volume of water left in each 
test tube.

Plant Transpiration 
Experiment 4: Measuring Transpiration Using a Potometer 
Transpiration is the biological term for the process by which water moves through plants. It also identifies the <span style="word-spacing: 1px;">process through which water is lost by a plant through evaporation. Water enters a plant through the roots, </span>and exits the plant through tiny openings in the leaf called stomata.   <span style="word-spacing: 1px;">This experiment tests transpiration rates of plants using a potometer. Four different environments will be in-</span>cluded to isolate the effect of temperature on transpiration. Students can use their results to determine which environments increase or decrease transpiration rate.  
Procedure 
Part A 
1.  Fill the 100 mL graduated cylinder with approximately 90 mL of water. Record the exact volume in Table 
1. 
2.  Cut the Parafilm&#174;
 into four, separate three cm pieces.  
3.  Secure one piece over the top of the graduated cylinder. Ensure that this creates a closed system by 
sealing the Parafilm&#174; 
around the rim of the cylinder. This will function as the potometer in this experi-
ment.  
4.  Use a sharp tip (such as the tip of the scissors or the end of a pencil) to carefully puncture a small hole in 
the center of the Parafilm&#174;
.  
5.  Remove the root (but not the stem) from your plant. Cut or tear the plant into four equal parts.  6.  Position one part of the plant in the hole of the Parafilm&#174;
. The stem should be stationed low enough so 
that the tip is submerged below the water in the graduated cylinder. Record the initial water volume of the potometer in Table 1. 
7.  Place the potometer in a room temperature environment. Observe and record the potometer's volume 
every 10 minutes for 60 minutes. Record your data in Table 1. 
 
Part B 
8.  Repeat Steps 1 - 4 and Step 6.  9.  Vertically align the plant and the fan (you will need to place the fan on top of something to achieve this).

Introduction 
The plant kingdom encompasses many different types of plants. Embryophyta is a subkingdom of the plant  kingdom which includes easily recognizable land plants such as mosses, ferns, flowering plants, and gym- nosperms. Land plants have multicellular embryos which develop within the plant. They are further divided  into vascular and non-vascular plants (or, bryophytes). Bryophytes encompass the oldest plant lineage,  and are estimated to be approximately 475 million years old. Certain embryophytes form seeds to repro- duce, while other types release spores. For example, bryophytes and some seedless vascular plants, such  as fern, release spores. Vascular seed plants have adapted to a variety of habitats due in part to the robust- ness of the seed. Note that the common green algae is not an embryophyte. Unlike land plants which often  (although not always) risk drying out, green algae is very hydrated as it absorbs water and minerals from its  environment. However, green algae can not be revived should it ever dry out, whereas many bryophtes are  revivable if rehydrated within a sufficient time period.    
Plant Life Cycle: Sexual Reproduction 
The life cycle of all embryophytes, vascular and bryophytes, includes a diploid generation and a haploid  generation. The diploid generation is called a sporophyte, and the haploid generation is called a gameto- phyte. Diploid sporophytes produce hardy, haploid spores using meiosis. These spores become gameto- phytes by dividing and maturing. Gametophytes produce gametes by mitosis. Two gametes from different  organisms come together and produce a zygote. The zygote develops into a sporophyte and the cycle con- tinues. This cycle is the process for sexual reproduction in plants.   
 Alternation of Generations
 
The fluctuation between mitosis and meiosis is known as the alternation of generations. The time spent in each generation of the cycle varies by species within the plant kingdom. For example, the dominant genera-tion in bryophytes is haploid. However, the dominant generation in most other plants is diploid.    <span style="word-spacing:0.7px;">There are similarities in how plants reproduce, but many differences are based on the size, form, and dis-</span><span style="word-spacing:0.8px;">persion method of their gametophytes and sporophytes.

Introduction to Science 
There are often many ways to test a hypothesis. However, three rules must always be followed for results to be valid. 
 
The experiment must be replicable. 
 
Only test one variable at a time. 
 
Always include a control. 
 
Experiments must be replicable to create valid theories. In other words, an experi-ment must provide precise results over multiple trials Precise results are those which have very similar values (e.g., 85, 86, and 86.5) over multiple trials. By con-trast, accurate results are those which demonstrate what you expected to happen (e.g., you expect the test results of three students tests to be 80%, 67%, and 100%). The following example demonstrates the significance of experimental re-peatability. Suppose you conduct an experiment and conclude that ice melts in 30 
seconds when placed on a burner, but you do not record your procedure or define the exact variables included. The conclusion that you draw will not be recognized in the sci-entific community because other scientists cannot repeat your experiment and find the same results. What if anoth-er scientist tries to repeat your ice experiment, but does not turn on the burner; or, uses a larger ice chunk. The results will not be the same, because the experiment 
was not repeated using the same exact procedure. In order for results to be valid, repeated experiments must follow the original experiment exactly. Using this tech-nique, multiple trials performed in this manner should yield comparable results.  
  
Variables 
Variables  are defined, measurable components of an experiment. Controlling variables in an experiment al-lows the scientist to quantify changes that occur. This allows for focused results to be measured; and, for re-fined conclusions to be drawn. There are two types of variables, independent variables and dependent varia-bles.   Independent variables are variables that scientists select to change within the experiment. For example, the time of day, amount of substrate, etc. can all be independent variables. Independent variables are also used by scientists to test hypotheses. Experiments can only have one independent variable. In this way, scientists can determine if altering the independent variable is the reason for obtaining a different result. Scientists would not be able to conclusively determine which change effected the data if more than one independent variable is changed in an experiment. Independent variables are always placed on the x-axis of a chart or graph.   Dependent variables are variables that scientists observe in relationship to the independent variable. Com-mon examples of this are rate of reaction, color change, etc. Any changes observed in the dependent variable 
If plants grow quicker when nutrients are added, then the hypothesis is accepted and the null hypothesis is rejected. 
Accurate results all hit the bulls-eye on a target. 
Precise results may not hit the bulls-eye, but they all hit the same region.

tive methods to seek out sexual partners. Early plants including  moss and ferns use water or wind to transport sperm for sexual re- production. Further developed plants which possess formed vascular  systems have adapted to other more complex methods of sexual  reproduction. For example, some flowers express brightly-colored attract insects to cross-pollinate. Other flowers express caffeine mol- ecules in their nectar. This caffeine is thought to improve memory in  honeybees, which improves the flower's likelihood of repeat pollina- tions.  
 
Unisexual vs. Bisexual Reproduction 
Plant reproduction can be unisexual or  bisexual. Bisexual reproduction occurs  when a plant incorporates structures  which are both male and female. Unisexu- al reproduction occurs when a plant incor- porates structures which are either male  or female. 
Mosses and liverworts are unisexual  plants that do not form seeds to repro- duce (Figure 2). This class of plants has  developed both male and female repro- ductive organs. The female organ is the  archegonium where the archegoniophore  (egg or female gametophyte) resides. The  male organ is the antheridium where the  antheridiophore (sperm or male gameto- phyte) resides. The antheridiophore de- pends on water for movement (dew, rain)  and male and female plants must be in  close proximity to each other for success- ful fertilization. 
Gymnosperms 
Gymnosperms (e.g. pine trees) are bisex-<span style="word-spacing:8px">ual plants that produce naked seeds. </span>
Gymnosperms are called the naked seed plants because they are not encased by the mature ovary (fruit) as <span style="word-spacing:2px;">other seed-forming plants are. Although each plant contains both the male and female reproductive struc-tures, there are in physically different locations. Typically the female reproductive structures (seed cones)</span>

Plant Reproduction 
are near the top of the tree while the male reproductive structures (pollen cones) are near the bottom of the  tree. These plants are called "wind pollinated" because they rely on the wind to blow pollen grains (male  gametes) to the ovule that contains the female gametes. Pollination occurs when the pollen grains come in  contact with the ovule. The pollen grains germinate and pollen tubes will grow towards the egg. Once the  tube reaches the egg, sperm are released from the grain and fertilize the egg. The zygote (seed) will then  mature and fall from the seed (Figure 2).  
Angiosperms 
Angiosperms, or flowering plants, are vascular,  bisexual plants. Both the male and female repro- ductive organs are found in a single flower. While  these plants can self-fertilize, cross-fertilization  (pollen from a different plant) is important to  maintain genetic diversity. The carpel  is a spe- cialized organ, unique to angiosperms, that en- closes the ovule and eventually matures into fruit  following fertilization (Figure 3). Angiosperms are  called covered seed plants because the devel- oped seed (zygote/embryo) is within the fruit. 
Angiosperms have additional distinct reproduc- tive organs called flowers. The gametophyte is  reduced to the female embryo sac, with as few  as eight cells and the male gametophyte devel- oped from the pollen grains. Pollen grains, the  male gametophyte, developed to protect the  sperm during the transfer from male to female  parts. Double-fertilization  is also unique to the- se plants. Like the gymnosperms, a pollen grain
that reaches the carpel will germinate. Pollen tubes grow towards the ovary and two sperm are released.  One sperm nuclei will fuse with the egg to form the zygote (2n). The other nuclei will unite with two haploid  polar cells (in the ovary) to form a triploid (3n) cell that will develop into the endosperm, a nutrient-rich tissue  surrounding the seed (fruit).

Plant Reproduction 
Experiment 1: Observation of Archegonium and Antheridium 
Mosses are the most common group of unisex, non-vascular plants, and are common in moist environ- ments. Long sections of the moss Mnium containing the gametangia are useful to gain a better understand- ing of the moss life cycle. The antheridium is a haploid structure involved in the production and storage of  sperm cells. Alternatively, the archegonium is a structure involved in the production and storage of ova. 
 
Procedure
 
1.  Examine the digital slide pictures of the archegonium. Look for the archegonium, a structure with a long 
neck and rounded base. Also, search for a single-celled egg within the archegonium. Label those struc-
tures. 
2.  Examine the digital slide picture of the antheridium (Figure 7, 8, and 9). Sperm-forming tissue will be visi-
ble within the antheridia. Label significant structures.

Introduction to Science 
are caused by the changes in the independent variable. In other words, they depend on the independent vari-able. There can be more than one dependent variable in an experiment. Dependent variables are placed on the y-axis of a chart or graph.   
Controls 
A control is a sample of data collected in an experiment that is not exposed to the independent variable. The control sample reflects the factors that could influence the results of the experiment, but do not reflect the planned changes that might result from manipulating the independent variable. Controls must be identified to eliminate compounding changes that could influence results. Often, the hardest part of designing an experi-ment is determining how to isolate the independent variable and control all other possible variables. Scientists must be careful not to eliminate or create a factor that could skew the results. For this reason, taking notes to account for unidentified variables is important. This might include factors such as temperature, humidity, time of day, or other environmental conditions that may impact results.  There are two types of controls, positive and negative. Negative controls are data samples in which you ex-pect no change to occur. They help scientists determine that the experimental results are due to the inde-pendent variable, rather than an unidentified or unaccounted variable. For example, suppose you need to cul-ture (grow) bacteria and want to include a negative control. You could create this by streaking a sterile loop across an agar plate. Sterile loops should not create any microbial growth; therefore, you expect no change to occur on the agar plate. If no growth occurs, you can assume the equipment used was sterile. However, if microbial growth does occur, you must assume that the equipment was contaminated prior to the experiment and must redo the experiment with new materials.   Alternatively, positive controls are data samples in which you do expect a change. Let's return to the growth example, but now you need to create a positive control. To do this, you now use a sterile loop to streak a plate with a bacterial sample that you know grows well on agar (such as E. coli). If bacteria grows, you can assume that the bacteria sample and agar are both suitable for the experiment. However, if bacteria does not grow, you must assume that the agar or bacteria has been compromised; the agar is inhibiting growth, or the bacteria in the sample are not viable.   
Data 
The scientific method also requires data collection. This may reflect what occurred before, during, or after an experiment. Collected data help reveal experimental results. Data should include all relevant observations, both quantitative and qualitative.  After results are collected, they can be analyzed. Data analysis often involves a variety of calculations, con-versions, graphs, tables, etc. The most common task a scientist faces is unit conversion. Units of time are a common increment that must be converted. For example, suppose half of your data is measured in seconds,

Introduction
 
Homeostasis, a term coined by Walter Bradford Cannon in the 1920s, describes an organism's ability to  maintain a relatively consistent internal environment. In fact, one of the key features which defines life is the  ability for an organism to respond to its internal and external environments. The internal environment  (cytoplasm, organelles, etc.) must be held within a tolerable range to maintain standard cell functions. In oth- er words, organisms (prokaryotes and unicellular or multicellular eukaryotes) need to maintain homeostasis in order to survive.

Recall that eukaryotic cells are considered to be structurally more complex than prokaryotic cells, and typical- ly contain more organelles. Within each eukaryotic cell, there is a network of membrane-bound organelles.  Each organelle fulfills a unique function, but they must all work together to maintain homeostasis within the  cell. 

Rarely do animal cells function as individual units. Cells with similar functions form tissues. These tissues  then combine to construct organs. Several organs may function together to form an organ system. Mainte- nance of homeostasis begins at the cellular level and involves tissues, organs and organ systems. Consider  that, within mammals, there are 11 organ systems that must communicate and work together. 
Homeostatic Properties 
Homeostasis is seen in properties such as temperature, pH, and chemical concentrations such as oxygen,  iron, etc. Devastating consequences can occur if the body deviates from homeostasis. For example, human  blood pH must remain at approximately 7.35 - 7.45. A person can become seriously, or even fatally, ill if the  blood chemistry causes the pH to rise above or drop below this value.

Homeostasis is no small feat. An organism is constantly breaking down and building biomolecules within  cells, which results in fluctuating chemical concentrations. Homeostatic mechanisms monitor specific aspects of the various internal environments and make adjustments needed to keep  those internal environments  within the optimal range. In most cases, these mechanisms consist of receptors which detect a stimulus and,  via an afferent pathway, report to a control center. The control center (usually the central nervous system) makes a decision and sends a signal, via an efferent pathway, to effectors. The effectors are the muscles or  glands that cause responses that alter the internal environment. A very basic example of homeostatic mech-

Mammalian Homeostasis 

anisms is a simple reflex. Heat and pain receptors will be stimulated by placing your hand on a hot object. The receptor sends a signal through sensory neurons (the afferent pathway) to the central nervous system  (the control center). The central nervous system sends a signal through motor neurons (the efferent path- way) to muscles (the effectors) in your arm. This causes your hand to be rapidly removed from the hot ob- ject. 
Adding to the difficulty is the dynamic quality of the extracel- lular environment. The chemical concentrations found in the  extracellular environment are often changing as different  chemicals and biomolecules enter the body. This results in  complex, and highly specific cellular processes which pro- mote homeostasis.

Positive and Negative Feedback 
An important aspect of homeostasis is feedback. Referring  back to the reflex example, you learned homeostasis can be  restored when the hand is removed from a hot object. How- ever, what if the room temperature were to increase by  enough to affect the internal temperature of ones body? How  does that increase change the response? The stimulus is  again heat; receptors can recognize the temperature change  and report to the temperature control center in the brain. A  series of changes will now occur, rather than the one specif- ic effector (as in the reflex example). The body may start to  sweat, heart rate may increase, and blood vessels in your  skin may dilate. The effectors in this case are sweat glands,  heart   muscles, and  blood  vessels. Once the body has  cooled off, feedback mechanisms take over. 

Feedback mechanisms  work to alter the response as homeostasis is reached. Negative feedback reduc- es the response when external or internal conditions return to normal. The majority of the feedback mecha- nisms are negative. This ensures that responses to stimuli will decrease once homeostasis is achieved. In  the overheated room example, negative feedback mechanisms will reduce each physiological response  when the body returned an acceptable temperature range. Sweating will decrease, heart rate will return to a  normal rate, and blood vessels will constrict. 
Positive feedback mechanisms work to increase the response to a stimulus. These are found in very spe- cific situations. The two main conditions that positive feedback is essential are during severe bleeding and childbirth. In both cases, an increase to the stimulus is warranted for survival.

Mammalian Homeostasis 
As previously mentioned, the 11 mammalian organ systems work very closely together to maintain homeo- stasis. Table 1 lists these systems along with an example of how each contributes to the maintenance of ho- meostasis. Note how each organ system, with the possible exception of the reproductive system, contributes  to the overall maintenance of the body.  
 
         
Body Fluid and Electrolyte Regulation 
Body fluid and electrolyte regulation are recurring themes when discussing homeostasis. Drastic, and some-times deadly, consequences such as cell lysis, toxic chemical concentrations, or insufficient oxygen delivery can result if homeostasis is not tightly regulated in body fluid. An electrolyte is any substance that conducts electrical signals. They readily dissociate into ions, and are often referred to as salts.    
Common Electrolytes 
There  are many important electrolytes in the body. A few key examples are: 
 
Sodium (Na
+
) is the most abundant extracellular ion. It is a critical molecule for nerve impulse 
http://cartridges.esciencelabs.com/Fluid-and-Electrolytes.swf
transmission, muscle contraction, and creates most of the osmotic pressure of extracellular fluid 
Organ System 
Examples of Homeostatic Function 
Nervous System 
Interprets, integrates, and reacts to the environment and internal stimuli. 
Skeletal System 
Allows for homeostasis of blood calcium levels by acting as a  reservoir for calcium. 
Muscular System 
Produces heat through contractions as when shivering.  
Integumentary System 
Prevents dehydration and regulates body temperature. 
Endocrine System 
Produces hormones such as insulin and glucagon. These two hormones regulate blood sugar levels. 
Circulatory System 
Acts as the major transport system for hormones, gases and electrolyte. 
Respiratory System 
Aids in maintenance of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in blood. 
Digestive System 
Involved in the absorption of nutrients and water. 
Urinary System 
Maintains water volume and regulates concentration of electrolytes such as sodium. 
Lymphatic System 
The lymphatic system helps regulate body fluid concentrations and transports fatty substances. 
Reproductive System 
Required for one function (reproduction) not overall homeostasis, unlike most other body systems.

(it attracts water into extracellular compartments). Kidneys control the flow of sodium from the body to maintain optimum levels. 
 
Chloride (Cl
-
) is another player in regulating the fluid movement between compartments, as well 
as forming HCl in the stomach. 
 
Potassium (K
+
) is the most abundant cation found in intracellular fluid. This molecule is essential 
for nerve impulse conduction, muscle contraction, regulating pH, and maintaining fluid volume, as  it attracts water into the cells. Aldosterone is a hormone that increases the reabsorption of  sodium and water as well as the secretion of potassium in the kidneys. 
 
Bicarbonate ions (HCO
3
-
) are prominent in plasma. In addition to balancing electrolytes, this 
compound is a major component of the acid/base buffer system, explained below. The kidney can excrete or extract bicarbonate from blood to alter the pH. 
 
Calcium  (Ca
2+
) is the most abundant ion in the body and is principally located in extracellular 
fluid. It serves many functions in the body, such as: as a structural component in teeth and  bones; functions in blood coagulation, neurotransmitter release, maintenance of muscle  tone,  and excitability of nervous and muscle tissue. Parathyroid hormone and calcitonin regulate the  level of calcium in blood plasma. 
 
Magnesium (Mg
2+
) is primarily an intracellular ion, functioning to activate enzymes and is needed 
for the operation of the sodium pump, neuromuscular activity, neural transmission, and myocardial function. 
 One way in which the urinary system maintains appropriate body fluid volume is by regulating the amount of water that is excreted in urine. In doing so, the concentrations of various electrolytes and normal pH of the blood are also controlled. The lungs are used to adjust the rate of respiration; which, consequently, adjusts the concentration of hydrogen (acidic) and bicarbonate (basic) ions present in blood. The endocrine system is also engaged to produce hormones which can control salt concentrations in cooperation with the urinary system. 
Dehydration 
The main way to regulate fluid balance is by altering the volume of fluid input. Dehydration  can occur if wa- ter output is greater than water input. As mentioned, the majority of water is excreted by the urinary system,  while other outputs such as sweating, exhalation, and feces also contribute. Fluid intake is partially regulated  by thirst sensations, which are signaled as a response to dehydration. This can be stimulated through a vari- ety of physiological changes in the body. Dehydration results in decreased saliva production, causing a dry  mouth. This activates tactile receptors in the oral mucosa that transmit nervous signals to the hypothalamus  to stimulate thirst. It also increases blood osmotic pressure, which consequently stimulates osmoreceptors in  the  hypothalamus  to  create a thirst  sensation. Moreover, decreased blood volume affects   blood pressure
and instigates the release of renin (a hormone) from the kidneys, which leads to an increase in the formation  of an additional hormone (angiotensin II). Angiotensin II ultimately causes an increase in blood pressure by  vasoconstriction and stimulation of aldosterone release. These  reactions  lead to the  intake of fluids, which

restore fluid balance when it is low. When there is an excess of water in the body, several hormones signal the release of body fluid through the excretion of urine. Antidiuretic hormone and atrial natriuretic pep-tide are the key effectors of this change to prevent water intoxication.   
Blood pH 
As mentioned earlier, blood pH levels need to be kept within a specif- ic range. Regulating carbon dioxide levels in the blood directly regu- lates the pH of the blood. Carbon dioxide will form carbonic acid in the  blood; by breathing slower the body will retain carbon dioxide and the  pH will decrease. In contrast, breathing faster will eliminate more car- bon dioxide and the pH will increase. In addition to changes in breath- ing, the bicarbonate buffer system is used in the blood to regulate pH.  The bicarbonate buffering system involves carbonic acid and bicar- bonate ions. Acids react with the bicarbonate ions, while bases react  with carbonic acid. This reaction is also a method for shifting carbon  dioxide through carbonic acid to hydrogen ions and bicarbonate, as shown:

Complete blood count, or CBC,  tests are one of the first procedures taken when working with healthcare  patients. CBCs provide a quick, yet  comprehensive, assessment of a  patients health by measuring a  glossary of blood constituents such  as red blood cell levels, white blood  cell levels, and platelet levels.

Introduction to Science 
but the other half is measured in minutes. It will be difficult to understand the relationship between the data if the units are not equivalent. (Sample calculation below). 
 
Example 
<a href="http://cartridges.esciencelabs.com/UnitConversions.swf">http://cartridges.esciencelabs.com/UnitConversions.swf</a>
When calculating a unit conversion, significant digits must be accounted for. Significant digits are the digits in a number or answer that describe how precise the value actually is. Consider the following rules: 
Addition and subtraction problems should result in an answer that has the same number of significant decimal places as the least precise number in the calculation. Multiplication and division problems should keep the same total number of significant digits as the least precise number in the calculation. For example: 
 
Addition Problem: 12.689 + 5.2 = 17.889   round to 18 
Multiplication Problem: 28.8 x 54.76 = 1577.088   round to 1580 (3 significant digits) 
 Scientific notation is another common method used to report a number. Scientific data is often very large (e.g., the speed of light) or very small (e.g., the diameter of a cell). Scientific notation provides an abbreviated expression of a number, so that scientists don't get caught up counting a long series of zeroes.  
Rule 
Example 
Any non-zero number (1 - 9) is always significant 
45 has two significant digits 
3.99 has three significant digits 
248678 has six significant digits 
Any time a zero appears between significant num-
bers, the zero is significant 
4005 has four significant digits 
0.34000000009 has eleven significant dig-
its 
Zeros that are ending numbers after a decimal 
point or zeros that are after significant numbers 
before a decimal point are significant 
45.00 has four significant digits 
15000.00 has seven significant digits 
Zeros that are used as placeholders are NOT sig-
nificant digits 
62000000 has two significant digits 
.0000000897 has three significant digits 
A zero at the end of a number with no decimal can 
be a significant digit 
50 cm exactly has two significant digits 
(not rounded)

Experiment 2: Urinalysis 
Urine is the waste product filtered within the kidney. The urine is made up of many waste products as well  as excess water. Urine is also a very helpful tool for doctors when diagnosing different conditions in pa- tients. For example. testing the pH of urine elucidates the processes the body is utilizing to remove acid  from the body and may point to system failures.
 
 
In this experiment, you will perform a urinalysis on four different samples of urine, testing a variety of differ- ent components. When all components have been tested, you will determine which of the urine samples are "abnormal" (use Table 3 for reference).  
 
Procedure 
Testing pH 
1.  Use the permanent marker to label each test tube as A, B, C and D. 
2.  Place the test tubes in the test tube rack. 
3.  Use a pipette to add five mL of Simulated Urine Sample A to the corresponding test tube.  
4.  Repeat Step 3 with samples B, C, and D. Use a new pipette each time. 
5.  Dip the reaction pad on one pH test strip into Sample A for 5 - 10 seconds and remove. Wait approxi-
mately 30 seconds and compare the resulting color on the pad to the color key (color key provided with the pH strips).

Introduction to Science 
There are three parts to scientific notation: the base, the coefficient and the exponent. Base 10 is almost al-ways used and makes the notation easy to translate. The coefficient is always a number between 1 and 10, and uses the significant digits of the original number. The exponent tells us whether the number is greater or less than 1, and can be used to "count" the number of digits the decimal must be moved to translate the num-ber to regular notation. A negative exponent tells you to move the decimal to the left, while a positive one tells you to move it to the right.   For example, the number 5,600,000 can be written in scientific notation as 5.6 x 10
6
. The coefficient is 5.6, the 
base is 10, and the exponent is 6. If you multiply 5.6 by 10 six times, you will arrive at 5,600,000. Note the ex-ponent, 6, is positive because the number is larger than one. Alternative, the number 0.00045 must be written using a negative exponent. To write this number in scientific notation, determine the coefficient. Remember that the coefficient must be between 1 and 10. The significant digits are 4 and 5. Therefore, 4.5 is the coeffi-cient. To determine the exponent, count how many places you must move the decimal over to create the origi-nal number. Moving to the left, we have 0.45, 0.045, 0.0045, and finally 0.00045. Since we move the decimal 4 places to the left, the exponent is -4. Written in scientific notation, we have 4.5 x 10
-4 
 Although these calculations may feel laborious, a well-calculated presentation can transform data into a for-mat that scientists can more easily understand and learn from. Some of the most common methods of data presentation are tables and graphs.

Introduction 
The kingdom Animalia comprises millions of species, ranging from the snail to the hippopotamus, the ant to  the elephant, the centipede to the human. Though there are notable differences in body shape and function,  almost all species are motile, multicellular eukaryotes. Unlike plants, animals cannot produce energy from  sunlight and, as heterotrophs, they acquire energy by consuming organic material (other plants and animals). 
Symmetry 
Symmetry is a useful characteristic for animal classification and  represents the balanced division of an animal's form. Radial  symmetry, as is seen in starfish, is a division originating in the  center and protruding outwards that produces even and balanced  sections. This is similar to the divisions that are made when a pie  is cut into many even pieces. Bilateral symmetry, as is seen in  beetles, occurs when animal structure can be divided into two  mirror images by a center line that runs through the entire object.  No equal divisions can be detected in asymmetry,  as is seen in  a sponge. 
 
 Invertebrates 
Animals are classified as invertebrates or vertebrates based on  their internal structure. Invertebrates  are organisms that lack a  backbone. They make up over 98% of all animal species. Exam- ples include the jellyfish, insects, or worms. Vertebrates  pos- sess an endoskeleton (an internal skeletal structure) and a spi-

nal column. A backbone or spinal column is a significant adaptive advantage that enables vertebrates to occu- py different ecological niches (roles). Examples include humans and dogs.

Invertebrates  
Major Invertebrate Phyla 
There are over 35 phyla in the Animal Kingdom. The vast majority of organisms fall within the following eight phyla, seven of which are invertebrates. 
1. Phylum Porifera  consists of sponges, considered to be the old-
est of the animal phyla (Figure 2). As stationary filters, sponges play an important role in aquatic systems, feeding on particles and bacteria in the water. Porifera literally means pore bearing which accurately describes the exterior surface of the sponges. Water enters the sponge through small pores and exits via larg-er openings. Nutrients are filtered out during the unidirectional flow of water through the sponge. Their asymmetric body is a loose assembly of cells (no tissues) that is supported by a matrix of collagen fibers and spicules. Sponges reproduce both sexual-ly and asexually.  
 2. The phylum Cnidaria  includes jellyfish, corals, sea anemones, and hy-
dras (Figure 3). They are thought to be the first animals to develop  nerves and muscles and typically alternate between two body forms: the  free-swimming medusa and the stationary polyp. Both body types con- sist of three layers of tissue surrounded by tentacles with stinging cells  containing tiny, toxic harpoons that can be used in either defense or of- fense. In fact, the name "cnidarian" is derived from the Greek word for  stinging nettles. They exhibit radial symmetry with a hollow body cavity  to digest food. Like sponges, cnidaria can reproduce both sexually and  asexually. 
 3. The phylum Platyhelminthes (flatworms) includes freshwater planaria, colorful marine polyclads, 
parasitic tapeworms and flukes. They are some of the simplest bilaterally symmetrical organisms  with a defined head and tail, and a centralized nervous system containing a brain and nerves.  They lack both a body cavity and circulatory system, but do have a tubular mouth, an excretory  system and a highly branched digestive system. Clusters of light-sensitive cells make up their  eyespots. Recent molecular studies using DNA sequences have aided in the classification of  many of these organisms which may eventually lead to a reorganization of this phylum. They are  hermaphroditic, capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction.  
 4. The phylum Annelida  is represented by marine worms (polychaetes), earthworms and leeches 
(Figure 4). They are bilaterally symmetric with segmented body cavities. These cavities are often represented as a tube within a tube design. Each segment has tiny hairs or bristles called setae

Invertebrates  
which help the organism to move. Segmentation was an important  development that provides distinct regions to specialize in different  tasks. A one-way digestive tract, closed-circulatory system, and cen- tral nervous system also differentiate this invertebrate. Annelids play a  significant ecological role by reworking soil and sediments. Annelids  primarily reproduce by sexual means with some members capable of  both sexual and asexual reproduction. 
 
5. 
The phylum Arthropoda, the most diverse and numerous of the Ani- mal Kingdom, includes insects, crustacean, spiders, millipedes, and  centipedes (Figure 5). All arthropods have segmented bodies and are  covered in a hard, flexible exoskeleton. The muscles from their jointed  appendages attach to the inside of this protective cover. Many spe- cies, such as dragonflies which  start as larvae and develop into  winged adults, exhibit multiple life cycles. Their open body cavity con- tains tissues, organs and a complete digestive tract. The vast majority  of members of arthropoda reproduce sexually.
 
 
6. The phylum Mollusca  includes clams, snails, slugs and the 
octopus (Figure 6). Though there is a great deal of diversity  within this phylum, all mollusks have soft bodies, many of  which are covered by a hard calcified shell. The shell is pro- duced through secretions from a layer of tissue called the  mantle (also known as the pallium). A muscular foot pro- vides locomotion and grasping. A coarse, file-like organ  (the radula) allows most mollusks to drill into their prey or  snag fish. Many hunt by propelling water through a siphon  either for locomotion or to capture food. A mantle cavity
houses gills and one-way digestive system. Ongoing molecular studies may lead to a reorganiza- tion of this phylum as more information becomes available. Most mollusks have separate sexes  and reproduce sexually, although some mollusk species are hermaphrodites.
 7. The phylum Echinodermata  includes sea stars, sea lilies, sea ur-
chins, sea cucumbers, and over 6,000 other salt water species  (Figure 7). Instead of bilateral or radial symmetry, most echino- derms exhibit a five part morphological symmetry. Their hard, flexi- ble bodies are composed of small calcium plates that are often  spiny and covered by a thin skin. In fact, the name  "Echinodermata" means spiny skin. Internal to the spiny skin, there  is a complete digestive system and a special fluid-filled system that

Invertebrates  
operates tube feet (which sometimes grow back if lost) which allow them to move, feed, and re- spire. Most organisms in this phylum reproduce sexually with a few specific species known to re- produce asexually. 
 8. The phylum Chordata  includes organisms that are invertebrates and organisms that are verte-
brates unlike the above seven phyla which  include  exclusively  invertebrates. Although  it may  seem unusual to have a phylum containing both invertebrates and vertebrates, there are four very  specific embryonic characteristics or traits that allow for this classification. That is, all chordates  possess each of these traits at some point during their embryonic development. First, all chor- dates develop a notochord. This rod-like, supportive structure extends the length of the body. Se- cond, a dorsal nerve cord running parallel with the notochord is established. The last two traits are  the development of both a muscular tail that extends beyond the anus and gill slits. 
 
Chordates have bilateral symmetry, segmented muscles, a protective layer (feathers, scales, hair,  fur, etc.,) and gill clefts (the structures located behind the mouth and in front of the esophagus).  The invertebrate chordates are the tunicates and the lancelets, both are types of marine organ- isms. Tunicates, more commonly known as sea squirts, look like sponges but have a notochord  with a dorsal nerve cord gill slits and a tail. Lancelets are small fish-like creatures that possess the  embryonic structures allowing for the classification of chordate. There are over 20 different spe- cies of lancelets.

Introduction to Science 
Graph:  A visual representation of the relationship between the independent and dependent variable. They are typically created by using data from a table. Graphs are useful in identifying trends and illus-trating findings. When constructing a graph, it is important to use appropriate, consistent numerical intervals. Titles and axes labels should also reflect the data table information. There are several differ-ent types of graphs, and each type serves a different purpose. Examples include line graphs (Figure 1) and bar graphs (Figure 2). Line graphs show the relationship between variables using plotted points that are connected with a line. There must be a direct relationship and dependence between each point connected. More than one set of data can be presented on a line graph. By comparison, bar graphs compare results that are independent from each other, as opposed to a continuous series.

Invertebrates  
The following lab exercise is intended to be an add-on for the Invertebrates Lab. You will NOT have the supplies to perform the next experiment unless your teacher has specifically requested that dissection materials be includ-ed within your kit. 
 
Experiment 4: Invertebrate Dissection  
The starfish is not a fish at all, rather an invertebrate that possesses no internal skeleton. Members of the phylum Echinodermata, starfish are unique in that they are deuterostomes (instead of protostomes like earthworms, grasshoppers, clams, etc.). Deuterostomes exhibit incomplete segmentation, and a brain and spinal cord above the gut, among of other differences with protostomes. Starfish have no front or back, and can move in any direction without turning. 
 
Note:  
When performing a dissection, remember these important safety notes: 
 
Dissect with the scalpel or scissor blade cutting away from you (and your lab partner).  
 
If you develop an allergic reaction to the preserving fluid, contact your healthcare provider. Also, inform your instructor and inform him/her of your situation. 
 
Contact your local waste management company for instructions for the proper disposal of your specimen.  
 
Wash your hands, dissection tools, and all work surfaces with soap and water when finished with the dissection.  
  
Procedure 
1.  Examine the external anatomy of the starfish. The side in which the mouth is located is called the oral 
surface (ventral side). The opposite side is called the aboral surface (dorsal side). See Figure 8
 
for refer-
ence. 
2.  Run your gloved finger over the surface and note the texture. Use the magnifying glass to examine the 
spiny skin in detail. 
3.  Along with the stiff spines, you may also see small, hair-like gills used by the starfish to take in oxygen.

4.  Pedicellaria are tiny pincers that look like pliers that are used to grip small objects. 
5.  Place the starfish ventral side up and note the tube feet that run down the arms, or rays, of the starfish. 
They will be located on either side of the groove that runs from the tip of each ray to the center. 
6.  Find the mouth in the center of the starfish. 
7.  On the oral surface of each arm are open ambulacral grooves extending from the mouth to the tip of 
each arm. Locate the abulacral groove running from the center down each ray. 
8.  Using the magnifying lens, examine the tube feet with protruding suckers on either side of the abulacral 
groove. 
9.  Flip the starfish so the dorsal side is facing up. 
10. Note the eyespots at the tip of each arm, which allows the starfish to sense and respond to light. Eye-
spots are pigmented regions near the tip of the arms, and are covered by a transparent cuticle. To see 
the eyespots, spread the tube feet at the tip of the ray and examine it closely with the magnifying lens. 
11. The flat central disk is at the center, and tiny, hollow, finger-like gills cover the body of the starfish. 
12. The opening of the water-vascular system is called the madreporite. It is a large, button-like structure 
on the central disk.

13. The anus is in the center of the disk. 
14. Using a scalpel, cut one inch from the tip of one of the rays. Study the cross section of the stump. 
15. Note the ossicles (part of the endoskeleton) on the dorsal surface, the largest of which called the ambu-
lacral ossicles, which support the ambulacral groove and provide attachment for the tube feet. 
16. Remove the skin from the top of this ray using dissecting scissors or scalpel. Do the same for another 
ray, and also cut a circular lap of skin from the central disk being careful to keep it as shallow of an inci-
sion as possible. 
17. Note the feathery-looking digestive glands called the pyloric caeca. These glands make enzymes that 
help digest food in the stomach, located under the central disk. The thin sac lying just above the stomach 
is the intestine. From there, the rectal pouches store small amounts of wastes before leaving through the 
anus on the dorsal side of the starfish. 
18. Remove the pyloric caeca from one ray, and observe the gonads underneath. 
19. Remove the gonads to visualize the water vascular system. This is an internal water pressure system. 
Water enters the system through the madreporite, passes through a series of canals until it reaches the 
tube feet. When the ampulla contracts, water is forced into the tube foot, extending it and allowing it to 
grab on to a surface. 
20. Running the length of each ray is a lateral canal, to which tube feet are attached. 
21. In the central disk, the five lateral canals connect to the ring canal. 
22. Note the stone canal connecting the ring canal to the madreporite, where water enters. These canals are 
difficult to locate without disrupting them, but see if you can identify them. 
23. With a magnifying lens,  examine the inside wall of the ray to see the supporting ridges, the bulb-like am-
pullae, tiny sacs that create suction of the tube feet. You may also notice tiny openings in the inner wall. 
These pores connect with a fill tube and are part of the external gills that help the starfish to breathe. 
24. As with any biological scraps, it is best to contact your local waste management company for proper dis-
posal procedure.

Vertebrates 
Introduction 
The two major divisions within kingdom Animalia are invertebrates and ver-tebrates.  Vertebrates  possess an internal skeletal structure called an en-doskeleton and a spinal column. This is a key differentiating feature be-tween vertebrates and invertebrates, which do not possess a hardened en-doskeleton. An endoskeleton is a significant adaptive advantage that ena-bles vertebrates to occupy different ecological niches (roles) and engage in a variety of unique animal behaviors. Examples of the over 60,000 verte-brate species include humans, dogs, and the llama shown in Figure 1.   Vertebrates are included in the subphylum Vertebrata within the phylum Chordata. Recall that the phylum Chordata  includes organisms that are both invertebrates and vertebrates. Although vertebrates and invertebrates are very different for many reasons, there are four very specific embryonic traits that all chordates possess at some point during their development. These traits include: the development of a notochord, a dorsal nerve cord, gill slits, and a muscular tail that extends beyond the anus.   Keep in mind that, as with many classifications, some vertebrate species might be included within the subphylum chordate in some resources, but not in other resources. For example, hagfish do not have true vertebrae but they do have a cranium. Based on the lack of true vertebrae, hagfish do not technically belong in this subphylum, but they often are classified within this group. To circumvent this issue, the term Craniata is frequently used. Cra-niata include animals within Chordata that have a skull.  
Fish and Tetrapods 
The two main groups of the subphylum vertebrata include fishes and tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles, birds, 
Figure 1: 
Vertebrate structure 
permits many different activities. For example, llamas are often referred to as pack animals due to their ability to distribute weight over their back and their historic companionship to mountain trekking humans.

Introduction to Science 
After compiling the data, scientists analyze  the data to determine if the experiment supports or refutes the hypothesis. If the hypothesis is supported, you may want to consider additional variables that should be ex-amined. If your data does not provide clear results, you may want to consider running additional trials or revis-ing the procedure to create a more precise outcome.  
Percent Error 
One way to analyze data is to calculate percent error. Many experiments perform trials which calculate known values. When this happens, you can compare experimental results to known values and calculate per-cent error. Low percent error (&lt;5%) indicates that results are probably accurate, and high percent error (&gt;20%) indicates that results may be inaccurate. The formula for percent error is:  
Note that the brackets flanking the numerator indicate "absolute value". This means that the number in the equation is always positive.   Suppose your experiment involves gravity. Your experimental results indicate that the speed of gravity is 10.1 m/s
2
, but the known value for gravity is 9.8 m/s
2
. We can calculate the percent error through the following 
steps:      
 The scientific method gives us a great foundation to conduct scientific reason-ing.  The more data and observations we are able to make, the more we are able to accurately reason through the natural phenomena which occur in our daily lives. Scientific reasoning does not always include a structured lab report, but it always helps society to think through difficult concepts and determine solutions. For example, scientific reasoning can be used to create a response to the chang-ing global climate, develop medical solutions to health concerns, or even learn about subatomic particles and tendencies.

and mammals). Fish  are aquatic and lay soft eggs. They are cold blooded and use gills to breathe. As the name suggests, tetrapods  include all animals with a four-legged body plan such as mammals and amphibi-ans. Amphibians, such as frogs and salamanders, are found in both water and on land and lay soft eggs. Amphibians are cold blooded and breathe using gills, lungs and through their skin.   
Amniotes, Reptiles, and Birds 
The development of amniote eggs provided animals (amniotes) with the capability to move away from wa-ter. Amniote eggs possess internal membranes that keep embryos moist. The two major divisions within am-niotes are the reptiles (non-bird reptiles and birds) and mammals. Reptiles  live almost entirely on land and lay somewhat hard shelled eggs. They are cold blooded and breathe through lungs. Birds  are found on land (and in the air) and lay hard shelled eggs. Birds are warm-blooded and breathe through lungs.   
Mammals 
Mammals, including humans (Homo sapiens), are normally found on land and most give live birth. They are warm-blooded and breathe through lungs. Mammals are also characterized by the presence of hair on their bodies and their ability to produce milk in modified sweat glands (mammary glands) for their young. There are roughly 5,000 species of mammals.   There are three mammalian groups or lineages. Monotremes are mammals that lay eggs and appear more similar to reptiles with their somewhat leathery shell. Monotremes produce milk which is excreted through openings found on the mother's skin due to the absence of nipples. The duck-billed platypus and two types of spiny anteaters are the only three monotremes species.   Marsupials  are pouched mammals and include kangaroos, koa-las and opossums. Marsupials give live birth to developmentally premature (or, altricial) young. The young make their way to the mother's ventral pouch. They continue developing while being nourished by milk supplied by the mother through nipples located in the pouch.   Placental mammals develop an organ, called the placenta, dur-ing pregnancy which acts to transfer nutrients and gases be-tween the mother and the embryo.  Placental mammals include primates, all marine mammals and rodents. In fact, over half of the over 4,000 placental mammals are rodents.

Vertebrates 
Homo sapien  
Arguably the most dominant vertebrate is Homo sapien (humans).  Humans are thought to be some of the longest living mammals, though other species, such as the elephant and whale are also long-lived. Though there are obvious differences between human beings and other placental mammals, there are also many simi-larities. Major differences include skeletal changes that have allowed for humans to stand and walk upright on two legs (bipedalism). Being bipedal also allowed for hands to become adapted to more specialized and novel roles. Human backbones are slightly S-shaped, which helps keep the body aligned over the hips. The human skull also differs so that it sits on top of the backbone with the spinal cord exiting the skull inferiorly.  
Figure 3: 
Human spines are naturally S-shaped. However, excess curvature may result in scoliosis.

Vertebrates 
Experiment 1: Owl Pellet Dissection 
Birds of prey often consume their prey items whole, rather than selecting for the digestible components. How-ever, proteolytic enzymes present within the bird's stomach are not capable of digesting all of the different structures found in an organism, and often can't break down items such as hair, bone, teeth, bones, or exo-skeletons. As a result, owls (like many other predatory bird species) produce and regurgitate pellets which contain many of these indigestible items approximately 18 - 20 hours prior to consumption. Very small bones or bone fragments occasionally pass through the pyloric sphincter and proceed through the digestive system, but pellets often contain complete animal skeletons.  
 
In this experiment, you will probe a barn owl (Tyto alba) pellet to learn more about the skeletal system's gen-eral physical characteristics. Note that some of the bones which you recover from the pellet will appear ho-mologous to a human skeleton (e.g., the ribs and vertebra), while others will vary significantly (e.g., the skull).   
 
Caution: 
The owl pellets have been heat-treated but may still harbor microbes. Wear protective goggles, 
gloves, and apron when performing this experiment. Thoroughly wash your hands and all work surfaces with warm water and soap after complete. 
 
Procedure
 
1.  With your gloves on, unwrap the aluminum foil from the owl pellet and set the pellet atop the black con-
struction paper. This will make it easier to identify the bones in the pellet as you dissect. 
2. 
Measure the dimensions of your pellet. Record your data in Table 1.
 
3.  Review the physical characteristics of the pellet such as texture, color, scent, etc. Be sure to use the 
wafting technique to detect the scent of the pellet (see the Appendix for a description of this technique). 
Record your observations in Table 1.

4.  Carefully use the toothpicks and forceps to probe the pellet. If your pellet feels very firm, submerge it in 
a beaker filled with water for 1 - 3 minutes to soften it. 
5.  Isolate any bones you come across. 
6.  Continue to probe the pellet for the bones, removing fur and debris from the bones. Note that the bones 
will be fragile. Be careful not to break any of the bones during the dissection. 
7.  Use Figure 4 to identify the bones found in the pellet. Record the bones you identify in Table 1. 
8.  Try to recreate the skeleton of one animal found in the pellet by organizing the bones in the arrange-
ment of the skeletal system. Pay particular attention to where the joints might have been located. 
Note: 
Each pellet is likely to contain bones from several different animal species. Be sure to refer to 
Figure 8 to complete this step. 
9.  Dispose of the pellet in a trash receptacle, and store the beaker in a place safe from students or ani-
mals.

Your lab kit will NOT contain the following materials unless specifically requested by your instructor!!! 
 Experiment 2: Vertebrate Dissection 
Frogs are a member of the Amphibia class of vertebrates. In many respects, the anatomy of the frog is simi-lar to human anatomy. Thus, the study of frog anatomy is a useful tool for scientists. As amphibians, frogs may live some of their adult life on land, but return to water to reproduce. 
Note: 
To determine the sex of your frog, examine the fingers on its foreleg (arm). A male frog typically exhib-
its thick pads below the thumbs. 
 
Procedure 
1.  Place the frog dorsal (back) side up in the dissecting tray. Observe the external anatomy of the skin. 
Don't forget to use your sense of touch in this observation (with gloved hands of course)! 
2.  Locate the following features: 
 
External nares (nostrils) 
 
Two tympani (eardrums) 
 
Two eyes, each with three lids (the third lid is a transparent covering on the eye) 
3.  Measure and record the length of the frog in Table 3. 
4.  Break a toothpick so that you have a two cm piece. Place this in the frog's mouth to prop it open so you 
can observe the structures of the frog's mouth. 
5.  Using the flashlight, locate the following features:

Tongue 
 
Two kinds of teeth; maxillary teeth help the frog to grip while vornerine teeth point inward. 
6.  Use forceps to grab the tongue and locate where it attaches to the floor of the mouth. 
7.  Insert the end of the fishing line into one of the Eustachian tubes and watch the tympanum on the dorsal 
side of the frog. This system allows air pressure to be equalized in the frog's head. 
8.  Place the frog in the dissection tray ventral (belly) side-up, and pin the arms and legs to the tray to stabi-
lize the specimen. 
9.  Using forceps and dissecting scissors, cut along the midline of the body starting at the cloaca (the uro-
genital opening) as shown in Figure 5. Make shallow cuts so internal organs are not damaged when cut-
ting through the muscle and breastbone. 
10. Make horizontal cuts near the arms and legs, as shown in Figure 5. 
11. Pin the flaps to the dissecting tray to expose the internal organs.  
Note: 
If your specimen is female, you may need to remove the eggs and enlarged ovary to view the 
internal organs.

12. Using a probe and forceps, lift the internal organs around so you can locate the following organs: 
 
Fat Bodies: Located just inside the abdominal wall, these long, thin organs are yellow or orange 
in color. You may remove these structures if they obstruct your view of underlying organs. 
 
Peritoneum: Directly under the body wall, this attached membrane of thin tissue forms a lining 
around the internal organs. There are various membranes that hold the organs in place, called 
mesenteries, which are also part of the peritoneum. 
 
Liver: A three-lobed organ that sits high in the body cavity. It is the largest organ visible, and is 
dark brown in color. 
 
Heart: A triangular structure that sits above the liver. Note the thin sac (called the pericardial sac) 
that covers this organ and the vessels extending from it. The pericardial sac can be cut to expose 
the heart. 
 
Lungs: Two spongy organs located beneath the liver. 
 
Gall Bladder: This bright green organ can be visualized by spreading apart the lobes of the liver. 
 
Esophagus: A tube that transports food from the mouth to the stomach. Insert your probe into 
the frog's mouth and observe where it leads. 
 
Stomach: Under the left side of the liver, this bag-like digestive organ is the first site of chemical 
digestion in the frog. 
 
Small Intestine: A long coiled tube that serves as a conduit for food and the place where nutrient 
absorption into the bloodstream takes place. Notice the blood vessels running through this organ. 
 
Large Intestine: A widening of the small intestine signals the start of the large intestine. This may 
be located underneath the small intestines. 
 
Spleen: Located in the middle of the body cavity, this dark red, spherical organ stores blood. You 
may need to lift the stomach and small intestines to see. 
13. Using dissecting scissors, remove the stomach from the body cavity. Cut it open to investigate any re-
mains from the frog's last meal. 
14. Remove the small intestines from the body cavity. Measure the length of the small intestines and record 
in Table 2. 
15. Continue to locate the following organs: 
 
Kidneys: Dark, bean-shaped organs that filter wastes from the blood. You may have to lift the 
intestines to see them, as they are towards the back of the body cavity. 
 
Testes (for male specimens): Located above the kidneys, these round organs are typically light in 
color.

Although the scientific method and scientific reasoning can guide society through critical or abstract think-ing, the scientific industry typically promotes lab reports as a universal method of data analysis and presentation. In general terms, a lab report is a scientific paper describing the premise of an experiment, the procedures taken, and the results of the study. They provide a written record of what took place to help

Introduction 
The word zoology means the study of animals, and comes from the Greek words for animals (zoa) and knowledge or study (logos). Zoology includes all aspects of animal biology from anatomy to evolution to be-havior. As one can imagine, the field of zoology is quite vast with many sub-disciplines, such as animal physi-ology, embryology, and ethology.  
Ethology 
Behavior encompasses a diverse set of activities, from simple responses to stimuli, to complex communica-tion and social interactions. Ethology  is the study of animal behavior, which debates the relative importance of instinctive versus learned behaviors. Instinctive behaviors are often understood to derive from genetically inherited material. Conversely, learned behaviors are thought to be affected by the environment in which an animal is placed. This debate is often referred to as nature (genetic) versus nurture (situational).   Animal behavior also refers to the manner in which animals interact with each other, other living beings, and the environment, as each of these conditions fluctuate. Environments are constantly changing; these changes may be small or routine (e.g., nighttime to daytime, summer to autumn, cloudy to sunny) or  large and consequential (e.g., nat-ural disasters, invasive species, etc.). Animals are equipped with a number of sensory organs that help them respond and adjust to these stimuli. A response among animals relies upon their abilities to perceive sensory information, which typically involves motion, light, or scents.   
Animal Movement 
One of the most common animal responses is movement to-wards or away from the stimulus. Animal movement is achieva-ble by nearly all animal species at some point in their lifespan, and thus provides a reliable mode to study behavior. For some

Animal Behavior and Zoology 
lower eukaryotic organisms, such as protozoa (meaning literally, "first animals"), movement can be undirected and random. Such unsystematic orientation is referred to as kinesis. In contrast, taxis describes movement in response toward (positive taxis) or away from (negative taxis) a stimulus. For example, movement toward or away from a specific extracellular chemical is termed chemotaxis. Taxis involves more complex behavior than kinesis, and is generally what we think of when referring to controlled movement.    Scientists study behavior and other aspects of organisms through observation and controlled experiments. A number of behavioral aspects which influence an organisms' survival and reproduction are hallmark ethologi-cal experiments. These behaviors encompass defense mechanisms (agnostic behavior) which animals use to protect themselves, as well as mating rituals that accelerate and enrich the progress of finding, attracting, and mating with another organism in the same species.  
Adaptations 
Animals must adapt  to their changing environment, or face possible extinction. This response can be pro-voked by changing climates, environments, or local food chains. Behavioral adaptations involve learned or inherited changes which benefit one or more organisms; while structural adaptations involve changing the body of an organism to meet the demands of a new environment (e.g. the thick fur of the arctic fox protects it from the cold). Structural adaptations are incited by genetic mutations which benefit the vitality of an organ-ism, and, in animals, must be passed on through reproduction. These adaptations are very gradual and re-quire a long period of time to proliferate throughout a population (depending on the lifespan, external pres-sures, mating frequency, gestation period, etc.), but are emblematic to the theory of natural selection.  On the other hand, artificial selection occurs when organisms are systemati-cally bred for specific traits. Examples of artificial selections occur in man's best friend, the dog. Different species are developed through the careful se-lection of individuals which express desired traits such as short hair, color, speed, or temperament.  
Sonar 
There are many examples of behavioral and structural adaptations throughout the animal kingdom. Dolphins, for example, developed sonar  to hunt using sound, instead of light. This is useful in environments which are exposed to limited amounts of light, such as deep in the water or at night. This type of so-nar, called echolocation, is extremely precise and allows for the location of objects. In addition, it affords dolphins with the ability to distinguish between objects of differing density. Developing a hunting mechanism that relied on sound, instead of light, is a huge advantage for dolphins as some prey items migrate from deeper ocean levels during the day to higher (or surface) ocean levels at night. The need to locate food in the dark quite possibly drove the evolution of sonar.

adaptive use of sonar, dol-phins also have a blowhole on the top of their head which is used for easier breathing.

Animal Behavior and Zoology 
Random vs. Nonrandom Mating 
Mating behaviors are frequently studied and can used to classify organisms. Mating can be random or non-random. One example of random mating is the sexual reproduction of marine sponges. This occurs when eggs in one sponge are fertilized by sperm that is released directly into the water. The mating is passive and depends on environmental factors or other species to achieve fertilization.  In nonrandom mating, mates are consciously selected. These systems are typically found in species where there are distinct male and female phenotypes. Many of these animal species are classified as monogamous, semi-monogamous or polygamous (having one mate, a few mates or many mates, respectively). Animal spe-cies usually exhibit very specific mating behaviors. That is, an animal species may be monogamous or polyg-amous, but not both.   Many animals exhibit nonrandom mating behaviors. A well-known member of the pheasant family, the pea-fowl, presents an excellent example of a nonrandom mating species. The male peafowl, the peacock, is ex-tremely colorful with his long extravagant tail. In comparison, the peahen expresses simple, brown plumage which can much more easily blend into the environment. Males use their colorful tails to attract females, even it makes them easier to identify by possible predators and it is much more difficult to fly away due to the weight of the tail. In fact, peacocks have been observed positioning themselves in the sun to accentuate their colorful plumage. Peahens are more likely to mate with males possessing a more colorful tail. However, this is not a superficial attraction as these tails represent more than just a pretty display! In order for peacocks to survive in their environments with this outrageous tail, they may have had to be the healthier and stronger or more robust individuals. Peahens select for these desirable traits as they may be passed down to their off-spring. This examples describes sexual selection, a subsection of natural selection. Interestingly, mating systems are frequently predicted by observing the behavior and appearance of the males and females in a species.   
Associative Behaviors 
Perhaps some of the most interesting animal behaviors are the long term interactions or relationships ob-served in nature between two or more different species. Relationships between species range from those which favor only one of the species, to those in which both species benefit. Parasitism  is an example of a relationship in which one species benefits and the other species suffers. Mutualism, on the other hand, is a relationship in which members of all involved species benefit. The term symbiosis  describes the long-term relationships between organisms of different species. Keep in mind that some resources use the term symbi-osis to describe only mutualistic relationships while others use it for all long-term interspecies interactions. 
 
Cleaning symbiosis is a fascinating example of the many types of mutualistic symbiotic relationships. Clean-ing symbiosis involves a species (the cleaner) that removes and eats substances and parasites from a se-cond species (the client). Many examples of these relationships are found among marine fish where a much smaller fish cleans a larger fish, as can be observed between gobies (the cleaner) and groupers (the client). Fish that mimic cleaners have also been observed, taking advantage of these relationships. The mimics act as cleaners to gain access to other cleaners or even to the larger clients.

Animal Behavior and Zoology 
Terrestrial cleaning, symbiotic relationships are also exhibited by Oxpeckers. Oxpeckers, a type of bird, are known to eat both adult ticks and tick larvae in addition to ear wax and dead skin. These birds associate as the cleaners with a variety of different mammals, the clients. Their clients include hippopotamus, rhinoceros, and cattle. However, field observations note that some cleaners 'cheat' and actually take the healthy flesh and blood from the client.   Zoology is an immense field and ethology is just one of its many sub-disciplines. This study of animal behavior is, in itself, a huge field. Re-
searchers continue to learn more about animals and how they interact with each other and their environments.

Experiment 1: Structural Adaptations - Foraging 
Animals often develop physical characteristics over time which allow them to succeed. Different environments provide specific, and sometimes unique, food resources which may require different adaptations. In this ex-periment, a variety of tools will be used to represent bird beaks, animal claws, talons, etc. and demonstrate how a physical characteristic can increase or decrease an organism's chance of survival. 
Procedure 
1.  Place the two pieces of paper next to each other on a flat work surface.  2.  Pour the foraged seed sample onto one piece of paper. 
Note: Not all of the items in the seed sample are actual seeds. Do not consume the sample. 
3.  Select the binder clips. 4.  Using only one hand, transfer as many seeds from the first paper to the second paper as possible in ex-
actly one minute. Record the number of each seed type that you transferred in Table 1. 
5.  Add the foraged seeds on paper two back to paper one.  6.  Repeat Step 4 - 5 for second and third trials of data.  7.  Repeat Steps 4 - 6 using the chop sticks, and then using the forceps. Once again, record the number of 
each seed type in Table 2 and 3, respectively, for each trial.

Post-Lab Questions 
1.  Did you observe any relationships between tool types and seed shapes?   
2.  What relationships did you observe between tool types and number of each type of seed transferred? 
3.  For each tool, describe whether it represented a generalist or a specialist. 
Experiment 2: Diet Alignment 
As observed in the previous experiment, diet is often influenced by the handling opportunities bestowed 
upon an organism. For example, it would be impossible for an organism to consume food which exists in 
deep, narrow tunnels without a long, thin finger or beak to grab the food with. The following experiment will 
further examine this concept through a visual analysis of beak shapes and food items.  
Procedure 
1.  Examine the beaks in the following images. Pay attention to shape, length, size, etc. Then, consider 
what types of food items could be handled or consumed by using the beak. 
2.  Use the images of foot items to match each beak to a possible food item. Do not consider geographic 
and environmental availability as factors in this alignment. More than one match-up may exist. 
3.  Include your match-ups in the Post-Lab Questions section.

Dissolved oxygen is oxygen that is trapped in a fluid, such as water. Since many living organism requires oxy-gen to survive, it is a necessary component of water systems such as streams, lakes and rivers in order to support aquatic life. The dissolved oxygen is measured in units of ppm (parts per million). Examine the data in Table 4 showing the amount of dissolved oxygen present and the number of fish observed in the body of wa-ter the sample was taken from; finally, answer the questions below.
 
Post-Lab Questions

Introduction 
Ecology  is the scientific study of both the interactions among organisms and the interactions between organ-isms and their environment. It is an interdisciplinary field that blends Earth science, evolutionary biology and general biology. Ecology explores the adaptations of organisms, the distribution of organisms and biodiversity.   
Ecology can be divided into different levels or categories. Ecosystem ecology looks at the "big picture". It fo-cuses on the cycling of chemicals and the energy flow within an ecosystem. Ecosystem ecology includes all the abiotic factors and species within an ecosystem. Community ecology is concerned with the interactions between species and how those interactions affect the structure and organization of the community. As the name implies, population ecology is concerned with populations. A population is a group of individuals of the same species living in the same area. Population ecology focuses on factors that affect population density and growth. Ecology of organisms,  or organismal ecology, is the study of individual organisms and the adapta-tions that have enabled them to survive in their abiotic environments.

ments, such as the desert climate pictured above.

Ecology of Organisms 
Abiotic and Biotic Factors 
Environments encompass abiotic and biotic components. Abiotic components include the physical and chemical aspects. Physical factors that affect an ecosystem include sunlight, temperature, water currents, wind, nature of soil, latitude and altitude. Chemical factors include available nutrients (in soil or water), water salinity, toxicity concentrations, and water levels in soil. Biotic components refer to the living factors in an environment and include the producers, consumers and decomposers. Producers are the organisms that convert inorganic material to organic substances. Plants are an example of a producer. By converting sun-light and carbon dioxide to carbohydrates, they are producing food for the consumers. Consumers and de-composers are completely dependent on producers for nourishment. Since plants are an important producer, it follows that sunlight powers nearly all ecosystems (aquatic and terrestrial).  Organisms have adapted and evolved anatomical, physiological, and behavioral characteristics that compen-sate for variation within the environment. The blending of ecology and evolutionary biology is probably most evident when examining organismal ecology. In this way, the environment shapes the organisms.   
Habitat Tolerance
 
Adaptations that organisms have developed allow them to compensate for minimal temporal and spatial vari-ation within their environment. This is accomplished, for example, by regulating body temperature or control-ling the rate at which water is transpired. Nevertheless, there are limits to an organism's ability to compen-sate for environmental factors. No single species can tolerate all of Earth's environments. The geographic distribution of a species is thus limited by the physical environment. That is, species distribution is limited by an environment's abiotic factors.  Although living organisms are found all over the planet, All species have a defined habitat tolerance assigning a viable range of environ-mental conditions. For example, some plant species can tolerate a broad range of soil variability, while others are confined to a single soil type. If a species has a narrow habitat tolerance because of one or more abiotic factors, then they are limited in their distribution range. Species with a broad range of tolerance are usually distributed widely, whereas those with a narrow range have more restricted distribution. Species can be categorized as specialists or generalists. Specialist species are those that have a limited diet or cannot tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions. Consider a cactus. A cactus has a limited tolerance for soil conditions, water levels and temperatures. Generalists, on the other hand, have a wider range of tolerance for environmental conditions and diet. For example, omnivores are typical-ly generalists, whereas herbivores tend to be specialists. Interestingly, invasive species are frequently generalists.

Dandelion (Taraxicum offi-
cionale)- species like the dandelion are very common and show no as-pects of rarity making them very common handling a broad range of tolerances.

Ecology of Organisms 
Habitat tolerance along with a species' geographic range (limited vs. widespread) and its local population size (large vs. small) determines a species' commonness or rarity. These classifications can be very signifi-cant to industries such as agricultural production and wildlife management.   As mentioned above, the environment shapes the organisms. What is the effect of organisms on the envi-ronment? Environmental changes are influenced by the organisms that inhabit that environment. In this way, organisms shape the environment. A change in species distribution can modify interactions within the envi-ronment. The loss of a native species or the invasion of a non-native species can alter the survival of other organisms within the environment. Therefore, control of invasive species and conservation of endangered species are important to maintain the balance of the entire system. 
Pre-Lab Questions 
1.  Would you expect endangered species to be more frequently generalists or specialists? Explain your an-
swer. 
2.  How does temperature affect water availability in an ecosystem? 
3.  Choose a species and describe some adaptations that species developed that allow them to survive in 
their native habitat.

Experiment 1: Effects of pH on Radish Seed Germination 
Natural soil pH depends on the parent rock material from which it was formed and processes like climate.  Soil pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of the soil. Acidic soils are considered to have a 5.0 or lower pH value whereas 10.0 or above is considered a strong basic or alkaline soil. The pH of soil affects the solu-bility of nutrients in soil water and thus it affects the amount of nutrients available for plant uptake. Different nutrients are available under differing pH conditions.   In this experiment we will look at the effect of pH on the germination and growth rate of radish seeds in order to determine the range of pH tolerance for the seed. Acidic or basic water will be used in order to stimulate acidity or alkalinity in soil. 
  
Procedure
 
1.  Use the permanent marker to label the top of each of the three petri dishes as Acetic Acid, Sodium Bicar-
bonate, or Water. 
2.  Carefully cut three small circles from the paper towel sheets. The circles should comfortably fit within the 
bottom of the petri dish. 
3.  Place the circles in the dishes, and wet them with approximately 2 mL of each respective solution (acetic 
acid, sodium bicarbonate, or water). 
4.  Gently press the reaction pad of three, pH test strips onto the wet paper towels. Record your data in Ta-
ble 1.  
5.  Arrange 10 radish seeds on each paper towel in each petri dish. Make sure the seeds have space and 
are not touching. 
6.  Place the petri dishes in a sunny or well-lit, warm place. Be sure to keep the paper towels moist for the 
length of the experiment with the appropriate solution if any of the towels dry out.

7.  Observe the seeds daily for seven days, and record the number of seeds that germinate in Table 1. Note 
when the seeds crack and roots or shoots emerge). On the seventh day, record the lengths of radish seed 
sprouts. Compare and graph sprout lengths below. Label the axes. 
 Post-Lab Questions
 
1.  Compare and graph sprout lengths vs. the fluid type below. 
2.  Was there any noticeable effect on the germination rate of the radish seeds as a result of the pH? Com-
pare and contrast the growth rate for the control with the alkaline and acidic solutions.  
3.  According to your results would you say that the radish has a broad pH tolerance? Why or why not? Use 
your data to support your answer.  
4.  Knowing that acid rain has a pH of 2-3 would you conclude that crop species with a narrow soil pH range 
are in trouble? Is acid rain a problem for plant species and crops?

Experiment 2: Soil Types and Water Availability 
The quality of soil is a subject of concern for farmers and gardener. Topsoil is the thin, surface layer of soil. It typically contains decaying plant and animal material that provides nutrients to plants. This organic rich top-soil also retains water in a way that favors plant growth. In this lab we will determine the water retention of different soil types. 
Procedure  
1.  Use scissors to carefully cut four, approximately 15 cm pieces of cheesecloth. 
2.  Place one piece of cheese cloth in the funnel. Place the funnel in the graduated cylinder. 
3.  Add eight marbles to the funnel. 
4.  Have your stopwatch ready. Then, use the 50 mL beaker to measure and pour 50 mL water to the mar-
bles. Start the stopwatch when the water begins to filter through the funnel. 
5.  Stop the stopwatch when the water has stopped running through the funnel into the graduated cylinder. 
6.  Record the time in Table 2. Record the volume of water in the graduated cylinder in Table 2. 
7.  Repeat Steps 1 - 5 three additional times (four times total). Use a different sample (soil, sand, or peat-

Experiment 3: Water Retention of Soil and Plant Growth 
The water retention of different soil samples was evaluated in the previous experiment. In this experiment we will test the effect of water retention on plant growth. 
Procedure 
1.  Use the permanent marker to label the three peat pots as potting soil, top soil, or sand. 
2.  Use the 500 mL beaker to measure and pour 500 mL of each soil sample into the corresponding pot. 
3.  Use the 100 mL graduated cylinder to measure and pour approximately 20 mL water into each pot. Moni-
tor the water as it enters the pot to ensure that the soil doesn't become too wet; more or less water may 
be required based on the soil type. Record the initial amount of water in Table 3 by subtracting the final 
water volume from the initial water volume.  
4.  Scatter a small handful of the seed mixture on the soil in each pot. The seeds should be relatively evenly 
spread out to ensure sufficient room for growth.  
5.  Gently press the seeds approximately one cm down into the soil. 
6.  Place each pot in a common, sunny area without placing them is direct sunlight. Use the graduated cylin-
der to measure and pour water into the pots with approximately 10 - 20 mL water daily. Record the 
amount of water in Table 3 by subtracting the final water volume from the initial water volume. You may 
wish to place the pots on a plate or something else to catch the water when it drains through to the bot-
tom of the pot. The water should not pool at the top of the soil.  
7.  Observe and record the growth for each soil type in Table 3. These plants generally germinate very 
quickly (three to seven days), so be sure to tend to their growth every day.  Be sure to evaluate the quan-
tity, size and thickness of the plant growth in each pot. Figure 3 demonstrates standard plant growth for 
each species in the seed mixture.

Introduction 
An ecosystem is composed of communities of living organisms at a particular time. This includes plants and animals, as well as non-living elements such as water, wind, heat, chemical constit-uents, etc. Each organism within a community has a habitat and a niche. An organism's habitat  is the location in which it physi-cally resides or is adapted to reside. An organism's niche  refers its function or "occupation". Occupation defines the way in which the organism obtains and sustains all of the elements needed for survival.     
Trophic Levels 
The dynamics of an ecosystem and the complexity of its habitats are a result of energy flow, nutrient cycling, and water. Organ-isms can be producers or consumers in terms of energy flow. These distinctions comprise the basis for trophic levels. Autotrophs  are primary producers; they make their own food typically using water, energy from the environment (e.g., sunlight) and carbon dioxide as their carbon source. In other words, autotrophs do not rely on other organisms for survival; they are self-nourishing. Autotrophs are the critical link between solar radiation or inorganic chemicals and every other planetary consumer. Autotrophs produce all the organ-ic compounds (carbohydrates, fats, proteins) that are critically needed by all other organisms.
 
  Phototrophs  use sunlight for their energy source while lithotrophs  use inorganic molecules (hydrogen sul-fide, sulfur, etc.) for their energy source. Photosynthesis, for example, is used by phototrophs to produce car-bohydrates from inorganic molecules as shown in the following equation:  
CO
2
 + H
2
O + light  CH
2
O + O
2 
Heterotrophs are consumers and obtain energy and carbon from organic molecules made by primary pro-ducers. Heterotrophs, therefore, rely on other organisms for their nourishment. Heterotrophs are sorted into levels based on what their diet includes. These levels are: primary, secondary and tertiary. Herbivores are

Ecological Interactions 
primary consumers whereas carnivores and omnivores are secondary consumers. Tertiary consumers are on top of the food chain and feed on secondary and primary consumers. They are sometime known as apex predators and can be carnivores or omnivores.    Organisms that share the same basic foods are said to be in the same trophic level (feeding level). Beginning with the au-totrophs, energy "flows" through the system along a circuit called a food chain. This occurs in the form of carbon-carbon bonds. Carbon-carbon bonds are broken for energy consumption when respiration occurs. For example, corn (a phototroph) produces carbohydrates (starch) which provide humans (heterotrophs) with a source of energy and carbon. Consider another scenario in which an herbi-vore ingests the corn and a predator consumes the herbivore. The herbivore receives its nourishment from the corn and the predator receives its nourishment from the herbivore.    
Biomagnification 
Biomagnification  is the accumulation of a substance as it works its way up the food chain by transfer of the substance from lower trophic level organisms to higher trophic organisms. Biomagnification results in higher or magnified substance concentrations for organisms higher in the food chain. Only about 10% of food calo-ries make it from one trophic level to the next in biotic feeding systems. Energy transfer is in no way 100% efficient. Inefficient energy transfer is what accounts for the classically depicted ecological pyramid, with a wide base representing the producers and a narrow top representing the tertiary consumers.  
Figure 3: 
Inefficient vs. Efficient transfer pyramid. There is a big difference in efficiency between 
direct and indirect consumption. Calories are lost as they move up the food chain, which also contributes to the fact that there are more prey than predators present in a given ecosystem.

Ecological Interactions 
Organisms at lower trophic levels eat small amounts, but higher trophic levels organisms eat many lower trophic level organisms; thus, chemicals accumulate in higher quantities. Biomagnification becomes a con-cern when the magnified chemicals are harmful to life or the environment. For example, mercury is not de-graded or excreted by organisms. It can be absorbed by autotrophs and ingested by consumers accumulat-ing in tissues. At each level, the concentration of mercury increases.    As mentioned above, all life on Earth is directly or indirectly reliant on primary production. Algae are extreme-ly prevalent autotrophs that undergo photosynthesis (mainly algae) utilize aquatic carbon dioxide and water to produce carbohydrates (CH
2
O). Recall that photosynthesis produces carbohydrates and oxygen.
 
 Dissolved Oxygen
 
Oxygen is a gas that comprises 21% of the atmosphere and is vital for the existence of life on Earth. It is a critical molecule to nearly every life process in organisms. Together with carbon diox-ide, it forms the closed cycle of gas exchange between land plants and animals. This holds true for aquatic life as well. But how do fish and other marine animals get oxygen while underwa-ter?   Water is a mix of compounds. While the majority of water is com-posed of water molecules, gases can become trapped among the water molecules as well. Oxygen is dissolved in water through diffusion from air and the photosynthetic activity of organisms, such as algae. Oxygen molecules can dissolve into a body of wa-ter similar to the way a sugar crystal can dissolve and disappear into a body of water. The attractive forces suspend the oxygen molecules between water molecules and prevent its escape from the water. Once in solution, the dissolved oxygen  (DO)  is  in  a free state and is available for use by aquatic organisms.   
Dissolved Oxygen Saturation Levels 
The oxygen level of a water system is not solely dependent on the production and consumption of oxygen. A variety of chemical and physical factors influence the abundance of free oxygen in water. There are several aspects influencing the maximum amount of oxygen that can dissolve. This maximum value is often called the saturation level. Factors which can influence a saturation level include: temperature, pH, water salinity, as well as the partial pressure of oxygen in the air (due to altitude). Increasing or decreasing these conditions will affect the saturation level of water. Thus, cold freshwater is optimal for capturing dissolved ox-ygen. 
Figure 4: 
Waterfalls can be beneficial to 
aquatic life because they introduce more oxygen into water systems. Water can absorb more
 
oxygen as a waterfall be-
cause more water surface is exposed to the air in a waterfall than a calm, smooth body of water.

Ecological Interactions 
  Additional characteristics of water systems may also affect the dissolved oxygen level in water. These in-clude the amount of air mixed with water (e.g., rapids, waterfalls, wind, currents, etc.) and the presence of plants that release oxygen during photosynthesis. Dissolved oxygen can be reduced by increased water temperatures, low flow (less air mixing with water), and organic wastes (Figure 5). Waste products such as sewage, farm runoff, and pollution may also stimulate the growth of bacteria and other oxygen-consuming organisms in the water. Each of these factors can also affect the distribution of dissolved oxygen in a body of water, leading to aerobic and anaerobic conditions and life forms in various locations throughout the water.   Once in the water, oxygen is used by marine organisms to respire. Oxygen is also consumed by bacteria to oxidize dead or decaying materials. Some materials may require a great deal of oxidation in order to break down to its components. This can often leave little dissolved oxygen for other organisms to use.   
Dissolved Oxygen and Water Quality 
For these reasons, dissolved oxygen concentration (measured in parts per million - ppm) is often used as an indicator of water quality. Many organic pollutants are utilized by the microbes, which consume oxygen for cellular respiration. Thus, an overgrowth of these microbes results in a decreased dissolved oxygen content in the water. If the dissolved oxygen content of the water falls below the threshold for living organisms (roughly two ppm), they will suffer from oxygen deficiency. These organisms may suffocate if the situation is not remedied.

Dissolved oxygen levels may vary based on the location and temper-
ature within the water body.

rule of thumb, water collectors should NOT wade into flowing water if the water depth (in feet) x  the 
water velocity (in feet per second) is greater than or equal to 10. If you have any hesitations regard-
ing water-safety, do NOT enter the water! 
5.  Immediately add four LaMotte Dissolved Oxygen TesTabs tm to the test tube. 
6.  Seal the tube with Parafilm&#174;
, making sure there are no air bubbles in the water sample. 
7.  Mix the solution by repeatedly inverting the tube until the tablets have disintegrated (5 - 8 minutes). 
8.  Compare the color of the sample to the color chart in Figure 4. Record the color in Table 2. 
9.  Completely submerge Test Tube 2 and seal with Parafilm&#174;
 while still under water. You may need to adjust 
the seal when the tube is removed from water, but try to minimize the amount of additional oxygen ex-
posed to the water after the tube is removed from the water.  
10. Wrap the tube with aluminum foil, and place in a resealable bag.  
11. Gather your materials and return home. Store Test Tube 2 in a dark location at room-temperature, for five 
days.  
12. Repeat Steps 5 - 8.  
Note: 
The difference in the dissolved oxygen levels between the uncovered tube and the covered tube 
is the biochemical oxygen demand of the water sample. 
Part 2: Effects of Temperature 
1.  Create a hot water bath by performing the following steps: 
a.  Determine if you will use a stovetop or microwave to heat the water. If using a stovetop, obtain a 
pot. If using a microwave, obtain a microwave-safe bowl. 
b.  Use the 100 mL graduated cylinder to measure and pour approximately 200 mL of water into the 
pot or microwave-safe bowl. 
c.  If using a stove, place the pot on the stove and turn the stove on to medium high. Carefully monitor 
the water into the pot until it comes to a boil (approximately 100 &#176;C). Use the thermometer provid-
ed in your lab kit to verify the water temperature. Turn the stove off when the water begins to boil. 
Proceed to Step 2.  
d.  If using a microwave, place the microwave-safe bowl in the microwave and heat the water in 30 
second increments until the temperature of the water is approximately 100 &#176;C. Use the thermome-
ter provided in your lab kit to verify the water temperature. Proceed to Step 2.  
CAUTION: 
Be sure to turn the stove off after creating the hot water bath. Monitor the 
heating water at all times!

right position.  
5.  After 24 hours have passed, open the jar immediately and test the dissolved oxygen concentrations by 
repeating Part 1: Steps 5 - 8.  
6.  Use the thermometer to measure the temperature of the water. Record your data in Table 1.  
7.  Retrieve the test tubes from the refrigerator and the room temperature environments and repeat Part 1: 
Steps 5 - 8.  Record your data in Table 1.  
8.  Use the thermometer to measure the temperature of the water in each test tube. Record your data in Ta-
ble 1.  
Part 3: Effects of Salinity 
1.  Use the 100 mL graduated cylinder to measure and pour 50 mL tap water into the 100 mL beaker. 
2.  Add one packet of salt to the beaker. Use a stir stick to mix the solution.   
3.  Label a new test tube as "Brine" and fill it with the salt-water solution until the tube is overflowing. 
4.  Test the dissolved oxygen concentration by repeating Part 1: Steps 5 - 8. Record your data in Table 1.

Experiment 3: Oil Spills and Aquatic Animals  
Understanding ecological interactions extends beyond reviewing the natural interactions between the envi-ronmental and animal factors. In fact, many would argue that human interactions with animals can cause an equally great (or even greater) impact on animals or the environment due to the number of species which become endangered or extinct as a result of human behavior. This may transpire through hunting, habitat encroachment, pollution, etc. In this experiment, you will examine the affect of oil and detergent pollutions animal coats.

Natural and Anthropogenic Causes of Succes-sion 
Introduction 
Environments are affected by the organisms that live within them. One example is plants helping to break down rocks and making organic matter that eventually contribute to the formation of soil. Such changes may or may not be helpful to the species that initiate the change. Alterations such as this that occur within the ecosystem contribute to a natural pro-cess called succession. Ecological succession describes non-seasonal changes in the composition or structure of an ecological community over time. Part of the observed change of this process is that some species become more abundant, and others become less abundant; potentially, even vanish-ing altogether. This evolution can last for thousands of years. Succession was one of the first theories in advanced ecolo-gy, and it remains of great importance in current research.  The dynamics of changing environmental landscapes are part of an orderly process that presents similarly in most eco-systems. The organisms that come to this habitat must de-velop a new community, and therefore are fast-growing and highly diversified. They tolerate a full range of conditions in order to survive. These species facilitate the changes to the environment that make it more habitable for other species; consequently, the environment becomes less suit-able for them and they are replaced by more competitive species. This progresses toward a more complex community with greater species diversity.     Lichen is a common example of the primitive organism which can colonize a barren environment. Lichen has minimal requirements for survival. Some of these include carbon dioxide (CO
2
)
 
from the air, moisture from pre-
cipitation, and bacteria which promotes photosynthesis. They also release carbonic acid onto rock surfaces, which encourages gradual (but slow!) rock-decomposition over time. This decomposition creates mineral par-ticles that ultimately contribute to soil generation.

Henry David Thoreau described succession in an oak-pine forest in an address he wrote in 1859 &#34;The Succession of Forest Trees&#34;.

Environmental Succession 
Primary Succession 
Succession on barren terrain, such as rock, sand, or other inorganic material, is called primary succession. Primary succession describes the very slow sequence of gradual colonization of an essentially lifeless area.  Examples of when primary succession occurs include retreating glaciers, emerging islands, and the formation of new lakes.

An example of primary succession.

canoes erupt near the sea, a new coastline is formed. This bare rock becomes an exam-ple of primary succession as organisms move into the lifeless habitat.

Environmental Succession 
Secondary Succession
 
Secondary succession occurs on sites where the vegetation cover has been disturbed by humans (e.g., logging, agriculture, mining) or abiotic factors (e.g., wind, fire, flooding) without completely depleting the sur-rounding life and nutrients. Most commonly, soil is the surviving ingredient to provide the lifeline for second-ary succession. Secondary succession occurs much more frequently than primary succession. It is also a more rapid process than primary succession, because the area has retained some residual fertility and pre-existing organisms that quickly colonize clear patches created by disturbances. Fast-growing grasses and non-woody plants are the first plants to colonize the area, followed by larger shrubs and eventually trees. 
 Climax Community
 
Both primary and secondary succession create a continually changing mix of species within a community as various disturbances affect the landscape. In some ecosystems, succession reaches a climax, when a stable community is produced. This climax community does not undergo further succession. Climax communities are usually highly diverse and can often survive severe disturbances. Many ecosystems, such as grass-lands, never develop a climax community. This is because grasslands experience frequent fires, disrupting the ecosystem. This disturbance kills the seedlings of shrubs and trees, and as a result succession is main-tained at the grass community level.  
Natural and Anthropogenic Factors 
A number of natural and anthropogenic factors in-fluence why and when ecological succession occurs. Every species has a set of environmental conditions in which it can thrive, growing and reproducing most efficiently. These species themselves can impact the surrounding environment, producing an engine of change that can lead to succession. Under the changed conditions, previously dominant species may no longer flourish; while others may become more prevalent. Ecological succession can also occur when sudden and drastic changes to an environment occur. Examples of such forces include forest fires, wind storms, and human activities like agriculture and de-velopment. The rise and decline of many species within the community demonstrates both types of forces of succession - the impact of an established species in changing the environmental condition, as well as the impact of a large external force that ab-ruptly alters the conditions.

Logging is an example of an anthropogenic 
cause of succession.

Environmental Succession 
Experiment 1: Winogradsky Column
 
Sergei Winogradsky (1856 - 1953) was a Russian micro-biologist and was one of the first scientists to study mixed populations of bacteria with differing metabolic abilities. He discovered many biogeochemical cycles in-cluding chemosynthesis, and is well noted for his crea-tion of the Winogradsky column.   In a Winogradsky column, two distinct gradients form in opposite directions. A high concentration of oxygen is found at the top of the column (the aerobic zone). This concentration gradually declines into nothing, at which point the anaerobic zone is created. On the contrary, a high concentration of hydrogen sulfide is present in the anaerobic zone. This concentration experiences a steady decline moving up the Winogradsky column, eventually fading into nothing and creating the aerobic zone.   Light entering from the top of the column also facilitates the growth of aerobic photosynthetic bacteria. These generated gradients allow for growth of a large variety of bacteria that reproduce the biogeochemical cycles on which life depends.

Procedure: 
Field Trip - Water and Soil Sample Collection 
1.  Identify a location that has water and soil available for collecting; and, which you believe has features 
abundant micro-organismic, plant or animal life. Keep in mind that you will need 8 - 10 cups of water and 8 - 10 cups of soil. 
2.  Use graph paper to sketch a diagram of where you will collect your water and soil samples from. Be sure 
to label the graph with descriptive information, and indicate any other critical information that might affect the water quality. For example: 
 
Has it recently flooded?  
 
Is the area experiencing a drought?  
 
Is there snow or ice present?  
 
What is the temperature? 
 
Is the surrounding animal/marine life steady/predictable? 
 
What kind of animals/plants are local to the area? 
 
What is the current humidity? 
 
This diagram is called a Field Report and will become useful should you need to re-assess the original environment. 
3.  Use the permanent marker to label each plastic bag with the location name and the collection date. Two 
bags will be used for the water samples, and two bags will be used for the soil samples.  
4.  Go into "the field" to obtain your samples. To do this: 
a.  Pack up your plastic bags, gloves, ruler, 250 mL beaker, and a copy of this procedure. b.  Obtain your water samples. You may collect your soil sample first, if you prefer. Refer to the bot-
tom half of this section for soil sample collection methods.  
Note: 
Some collectors may wish to wade into the water to obtain their water sample. As a gen-
eral rule of thumb, water collectors should NOT wade into flowing water if the water depth (in feet) x the water velocity (in feet per second) is greater than or equal to 10. If you have any hesitations regarding water-safety, do NOT enter the water! It is always best to perform this step with a partner, if possible.  i.  Completely submerge the 250 mL beaker in the water body, being careful to 
avoid collecting sediment and debris if possible. 
ii.  Transfer the water from the beaker into one of the plastic bags designated for 
your water sample. Repeat this process five times for each bag (a total of 10 times). 
iii.  Seal the bags tightly and store or set aside until you leave the area. 
c.  Collect your soil sample. It is ideal to use the same environment from which the water 
sample was collected. However, you may move to a new location if necessary.  
i.  Remove any surface debris (plant residues/leaves/branches/thatch/etc.) from the soil site. ii.  Insert your trowel into the soil using the following depth guidelines depending on the soil 
environment:

 421 
Environmental Succession 
 
Sample  the soil down approximately 15 - 20 cm deep if collecting from a garden/flower bed zone (use your ruler to approximate the depth). 
 
Sample the soil down about seven to eight cm. deep if collecting from a turf zone. 
 
Sample the soil down approximately 20 - 30 cm deep if collecting from a root zone. 
 
Collect in between crop rows if collecting from a fertilizer band. 
 
Try to sample dark, light, limed, and unlimed soil areas separately. 
iii.  Scoop up the soil, and transfer it into one of the plastic bags designated for the soil. The 
trowel in your lab kit can contain 
1
/
3
 of a cup. Therefore, you will need to repeat this pro-
cess 12 to 15 times for each plastic bag (a total of 24 to 30 times) 
iv.  Try to return back to your "lab" without changing the structure of the soil composition. Nat-
ural clumps, rocks, etc. should be maintained to get a more authentic understanding of the soil porosity and biochemical habitat. 
5.  Use the scissors to carefully cut off the top of the bottle to remove the narrow, conical region. 6.  Put approximately 946 mL (4 C.) of the dirt/mud into a large bowl or bucket, add one bag (5 g.) of the 
calcium carbonate, and one bag (5 g.) of the calcium sulfate to the mixture.  
7.  Add enough of the water you collected to produce a thick, but somewhat fluid, mixture. This should re-
quire approximately 946 mL (4 C.).  
8. Add approximately 
1
/
2
 of the shredded newspaper to the bowl and mix again. 
9.  Transfer this mixture to the soda bottle and tap the bottle on the ground or other hard surface to pack the 
mixture tightly to the bottom. It is important that no air pockets or bubbles exist in this layer. 
10. Use a paint stirrer to further pack the mud and remove any air.  11. Add approximately 236 mL (1 C.) of the remaining dirt/mud on top of the previous layer and tap again to 
pack it down. 
12. Add water to a depth of approximately two to three cm above the last layer and make a small mark with 
a permanent marker on the bottle at the top of the water level.  
13. Let the column sit undisturbed for 30 minutes. Monitor the depth of the water during this period. If the 
water level rises, remove some to maintain the original level. If the water level decreases, add more to maintain the original level. There should be approximately two to three cm of air space above the water. 
14. Cover the top with Parafilm&#174;
 and secure with a rubber band.  
15. Repeat the Steps 5 - 13 to create a second Winogradsky column. 16. Incubate the columns for 6 -10 weeks at room temperature. Place one column near a south-facing win-
dow to receive indirect sunlight, or approximately 60 cm away from a lamp with a 40 - 60 W. bulb. Place the second column in a dark location (without natural or artificial light). Remember to rotate the columns 180&#176; once a week. 
17. Observe the column every seven days, and record your observations in Table 1.

Good Laboratory Practices 
 
Science labs, whether at universities or in your home, are places of ad-venture and discovery. One of the first things scientists learn is how excit-ing experiments can be. However, they must also realize science can be dangerous without some instruction on good laboratory practices. 
 
Read the protocol thoroughly before starting any new experiment. You should be familiar with the action required every step of the way. 
 
Keep all work spaces free from clutter and dirty dishes. 
 
Read the labels on all chemicals, and note the chemical safety rating on each container. Read all Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) prior to each experiment. These are provided on 
www.eScienceLabs.com.
 
 
Thoroughly rinse labware (test tubes, beakers, etc.) between ex-periments.  To do so, wash with a soap and hot water solution using a bottle brush to scrub.  Rinse completely at least four times. Let air dry. 
 
Use a new pipette for each chemical dispensed. 
 
Wipe up any chemical spills immediately. Check MSDSs for special handling instructions (provided on 
www.eScienceLabs.com). 
 
An underpad will prevent any spilled liquids from contaminat-ing the surface you work on.

 428 
Good Lab Techniques 
 
Use test tube caps or stoppers to cover test tubes when shaking or mixing - not your finger! 
 
When preparing a solution, refer to a protocol for any specific instructions on preparation. Weigh out the desired amount of chemicals, and transfer to a beaker or graduated cylinder. Add LESS than the required amount of water. Swirl or stir to dissolve the chemical (you can also pour the solution back and forth between two test tubes), and once dissolved, trans-fer to a graduated cylinder and add the required amount of liquid to achieve the final volume. 
 
A molar (M) solution is one in which one liter (L) of solution contains the number of grams equal to its molecular weight. 
 
Ex: 
1 M = 110 g CaCl % 1 L 
 
 
(The formula weight of CaCl is 110 g/mol) 
 
 
A percent solution can be prepared by percentage of weight of chemical to 100 mL of solvent (w/v) , or volume of chemical in 100ml of solvent (v/v). 
 Ex: 
 
 
 
 
20 g NaCl % 80 mL H
2
O = 20% w/v NaCl solution 
 
 
Concentrated solutions, such as 10X, or ten times the normal strength, are diluted such that the final concentration of the solution is 1X.
 
To make a 100 mL solution of 1X TBE from a 10X solution: 
 
 
10 mL 10X TBE % 90 mL water = 100 mL 1X TBE 
 
 
Always read the MSDS before disposing of a chemical to insure it does not require extra measures. (provided on 
www.eScienceLabs.com
) 
 
Don't pour unused chemical back into the original bottle. 
 
Avoid prolonged exposure of chemicals to direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. 
 
.Immediately secure the lid of a chemical after use. 
 
Prepare a dilution using the following equation: 
c
1
v
1
 = c
2
v
2
 
Where c
1
 is the concentration of the original solution, v
1
 is the volume of the original solution, and 
c
2
 and v
2
 are the corresponding concentration and volume of the final solution. Since you know c
1
, 
c
2
, and v
2
, you solve or v
1
 to figure out how much of the original solution is needed to make a cer-
tain volume of a diluted concentration. 
Disposable pipettes aid in accurate measuring of small volumes of 
 
liquids. It is important to use a new pipet for each chemical to avoid  contamination.

Good Lab Techniques 
 
If you are ever required to smell a chemical, always waft a gas toward you, as shown in the image below. This means to wave your hand over the chemical towards you. Never directly smell a chemical. Never smell a gas that is toxic or otherwise dangerous. 
 
Use only the chemicals needed for the activity. 
 
Keep lids closed when a chemical is not being used. 
 
When diluting an acid, always pour the acid into the water. Never pour water into an acid. 
 
Never return excess chemical back to the original bottle. This can contaminate the chemical sup-ply. 
 
Be careful not to interchange lids between different chemical bottles. 
 
When pouring a chemical, always hold the lid of the chemical bottle between your fingers. Never lay the lid down on a surface. This can contaminate the chemical supply.  
 
When using knives or blades, always cut away from yourself. 
 
Wash your hands after each experiment.

Introduction 
If you've ever seen the Frankenstein movies, then you are probably familiar with Hollywood's interpretation of a laboratory as a dark, dungeonesque space with a mad scientist in action. However, although lab experi-ences may often appear haphazard in movies, real-world scientists develop and incorporate organized proto-cols to keep lab environments safe. In addition to focusing on safe lab practices, the experiments in this lab manual will help you to learn about "green", environmentally-friendly chemicals and adhere to safety precau-tions.   Before beginning these labs, you must first realize there are specific techniques and precautions to learn to decrease the risks involved. You will need to learn the location of certain items, rules, and the names of com-mon lab equipment.  After you get acquainted with your surroundings, you will be prepared and comfortable completing the labs in this manual.   This manual is written for a 
"Green Chemistry" 
approach. This means the activities in this manual are gener-
ally safer and produce less hazardous waste than similar experiments found in other lab manuals. The chemicals used are environmentally friendly and can be discarded down a household drain with running wa-ter. Each of these experiments has been performed safely by other students. However, safer and less haz-ardous waste does not mean accidents, injuries, or damage will not happen. Scrapes and burns are always a possibility. These experiments will likely be performed in a household environment, so be sure a working fire extinguisher is accessible. You are advised to always use the safety glasses and gloves provided in your kit.  Note that the gloves provided in your lab kit are nitrile-based, rather than latex. Please contact eScience Labs at 1-888-ESL-KITS or info@eScienceLabs.com if you require an alternate.  
Safety Equipment 
 
Safety Goggles/Glasses: Safety goggles and glasses are used to protect your eyes, and should be worn at all times when in a biology laboratory, even if you are not currently working with chem-icals. 
 
Gloves: At times, you may need to wear gloves to protect your hands from harmful chemicals or hot objects. The type of glove needed will depend on the application. For example, oven mitts are

worn to remove hot objects from an oven while vinyl or latex gloves are used when working with acids and bases. It is very im-portant not to touch your work area with gloves that have been contaminated with harmful chemicals. 
 
Safety Shower: A safety shower is used when a hazardous chemical is spilled on a person where they are unable to rinse it off thoroughly in the sink. It can also be used if a person's clothes catch on fire. Most safety showers are operated by pulling a chain, although a standard home shower will also work. If a sink is insufficient to thoroughly rinse yourself, get to the nearest shower in your home as quickly as possible. This is not a time for modesty. Remove the contaminated clothing while rinsing your skin with a copious amount of water. 
 
Eye Wash: An eye wash is used if a harmful chemical is splashed into your eyes or face. It is usually operated by pushing forward on a handle. In the home, find the nearest sink and flush water in your eyes for at least 20 minutes. If your sink has a sprayer, use it to rinse your eyes or face while making sure the water drains into the sink. 
 
Fire Extinguisher: A fire extinguisher is used to put out small to medium fires.   
 
Laboratory Fume Hood: A laboratory fume hood removes harmful gases and fumes sometimes present when doing an experiment. You should always work in a fume hood whenever you are working with corrosive, noxious, or flammable materials. Chemicals used in this kit will not re-quire the use of a fume hood. 
 
Besides knowing where the safety equipment is located and how and when to use it, there are general safe-ty rules you need to follow in the laboratory. Some of the common safety rules are listed below. 
 
Laboratory Safety Rules      
1.  Always wear safety glasses or goggles. Never wear contact lenses. 
2.  Never attempt unauthorized experiments. 
3.  Always have someone available to help in the event of an accident. 
4.  Never have food, drink, chewing gum, or tobacco in the laboratory. 
5.  Always keep your work area free of clutter. 
6.  Always wear a protective apron and sensible clothing. This means no loose clothing, bare mid-

riffs, or open-toe shoes. 
7.  Know the location of and how to use safety equipment in your home. This includes showers, fire 
extinguishers, and sinks. 
8.  Always read the experiment entirely before beginning the procedure.  
9.  Always wash hands before leaving the lab. 
10.  Tie back long hair.  
11.  Never run or play practical jokes in the experiment area. 
12.  Place broken glass in a protective container, never loosely in a trash can. 
 
In addition to following the general safety rules, chemicals need to be handled properly. In particular, two very important classes of compounds called acids  and  bases  require special attention. These compounds are commonly used reagents in the laboratory; therefore, understanding their proper disposal is beneficial.   Physical differences between acids and bases can be detected by the some of the five senses, including taste and touch. Acids have a sour or tart taste and can produce a stinging sensation to broken skin. For ex-
ample, lemon juice tastes sour. Alternatively, bases have a bitter taste and a slippery texture. Soap and many cleaning products are bases.   Acids and bases are measured on a scale called pH.  pH, or potential hydro-gen, is  calculated using a mathematical equation that accounts for some of the chemical differences in acidic and basic compounds. This scale helps us quickly determine if a solution is very acidic, a little acidic, neutral (neither acidic nor basic), a little basic, or very basic. pH values range from less than 1 to 14. A pH of 1 is highly acidic, a pH of 14 is highly basic (or alkaline), and a pH of 7 is neutral. Table 1 lists the pH of several foods.  pH indicators, which change color under a certain pH level, can be used to determine whether a solution is acidic or basic. For example, litmus paper is made by coating a piece of paper with litmus, which changes color at around a pH of 7. Either red or blue litmus paper can be purchased de-pending on the experimental needs. Blue litmus paper remains blue when dipped in a base, but turns red when dipped in an acid, while red litmus paper stays red when dipped in an acid, but turns blue when in contact with a base.

General Lab Safety 
Acids and bases can react with each other. In this case, the two opposites cancel each other out resulting in a product that is neither an acid nor a base. This type of reaction is called a neutralization reaction. Neu-tralization of an acid or base is a technique frequently used for the proper disposal of the compound. The neutralized product can usually be disposed of by flushing it down a sink.  Keep in mind that in a typical laboratory strong acids and bases, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodi-um hydroxide (NaOH), are commonly utilized. As mentioned previously, the experiments in this lab manual are designed with a green approach. That means that the acids and bases, in addition to the other chemi-cals classes, used in this manual are safe for direct disposal.   Some general guidelines for handling chemicals properly are listed below. 
Handling Chemicals 
1. 
Always add acids to water, never water to 
acids. 
2. 
Never return unused chemicals to the bottles from where they were first obtained. 
3. 
Dispose of used chemicals in the proper 
waste containers and/or as instructed. 
4. 
Always clean the work area, and put away extra equipment when laboratory work is completed. 
5. 
Never leave anything unattended while it is being heated or is reacting rapidly. 
6.
Never carry out a reaction or heat a sub-stance in a closed system.
7. 
Always be careful when working with previously heated objects. 
8. 
Always replace stoppers or lids on bottles containing chemicals. 
9. 
Weigh chemicals in weigh boats or on paper provided for that purpose. Never weigh chemicals by placing them directly on the scale. 
10. 
Label all chemicals clearly and completely.

Gloves and glasses should be worn at 
all times in the laboratory.

General Lab Safety 
11.  Read labels carefully before using chemicals. 
12.  Always lubricate glass tubing or thermometers before inserting them into rubber stoppers. 
13.  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all chemicals provided can be found on our website at 
<a href="http://www.esciencelabs.com/educators/msds">www.esciencelabs.com/educators/msds</a>
.These sheets contain all needed information regard-
ing the danger, safety and disposal of every chemical. Download, print, and review the MSDS for each chemical prior to using that chemical. 
 E
ven though you follow all of the safety rules, accidents can still happen. This is why it is so important to 
know what to do for each type of accident.    
How to Respond to Accidents 
1.  Chemical Spills (on the Bench or Floor): Be sure to clean up the spill immediately. If the spill involves 
volatile or flammable materials, such as alcohol, make sure ALL flames in the lab area are extinguished and spark-producing equipment is shutdown.  In the case of an acid spill, pour baking soda on the acid before cleaning up. In the case of a base spill, pour vinegar on the base before cleaning it up. All other chemicals used in this manual can be cleaned up as you normally would. If you have any questions, check the MSDS.  
2.  Hazardous Chemical Spills (on a Person): If the spill covers a large area, the typical course of action 
is to remove all contaminated clothing while the person is under the safety shower. If it is a small area, flush the area immediately with a large amount of water and then wash it with soap. Check the MSDS for the spilled chemical and follow all instructions. Medical assistance may be necessary. 
3.  Chemicals Spills (in the Eyes): If a harmful chemical is splashed on your face and/or in your eyes, im-
mediate attention is critical. Call for help and get to the nearest sink. If the chemical splashes
 
on your 
face, and you have glasses on, KEEP the glasses on. Remove the chemical from your face before you remove the glasses. If a chemical gets in your eyes, hold your eyes open in the eyewash for at least 20 minutes. Even though you should not be wearing contact lenses in the lab, if you are, rinse your eyes thoroughly, remove your contacts, and continue to rinse your eyes. A doctor should examine your eyes as soon as possible.   
4.  Chemical Ingestion: Check the MSDS immediately. Call 911 or "Poison Help" at 1-800-222-1222. 
5.  Burns: Flush the area with cool running water for 20 minutes. Medical attention may be necessary. 
6.  Cuts and Wounds: If a chemical gets into the cut or wound, rinse it off immediately with a large amount 
of water. Avoid contamination, and check the MSDS.  
7.  Fire: Fires in a laboratory are often contained in pieces of glassware, such as a beaker. You should not 
move a beaker that has a chemical burning in it. Instead, extinguish the fire simply by covering the mouth of the beaker with a thin curved piece of glass called a watch glass and turning off the source of the flame. A plate or pie pan can also work in place of a watch glass. If the fire is not easily covered, you can use a fire extinguisher. If the fire is too large to extinguish quickly, clear the home and call the fire

Clothing fires can be extinguished in a safety shower if it is close by. If it is not very close, you will need to 
STOP, DROP, and ROLL 
to quickly smother the fire.

Introduction 
Myriad reactions are constantly occurring within each living organism regardless of the size of that organism. These reactions allow the organism to reproduce, grow, move, eat, and perform a great many more functions. In order to properly study these biological reactions a general understanding of chemistry is necessary.    The term matter is used to describe anything that occupies space and has mass. Take a look around, every-thing you can see and touch is matter (including you). The atomic theory states that all matter is made of atoms. Although physicists and other scientists have developed ways to split atoms to produce nuclear ener-gy, atoms are considered the smallest indivisible unit of all matter. The word atom, in fact, comes from the Greek word atomos meaning 'cannot be cut' or 'indivisible'.   
Subatomic Particles 
Atoms contain three types of subatomic particles: electrons (negatively charged particles), protons (positively charged particles) and neutrons (uncharged, neutral particles). Within an atom, the subatomic particles are arranged so that the proton(s) and neutron(s) form a nucleus. The electrons orbit around the nucleus in a very specific manner. This atomic structure is analogous to the manner in which the planets orbit around the sun in our solar system. In this example, the nucleus represents the sun and the electrons represent the orbiting planets. However, instead of gravity holding the atom to-gether, positively-charged proton attract negatively-charged electrons in an electrostatic manner.

Diatomic oxygen molecules share four va-
lence electrons through covalent bonding. Note the electron orbitals and the proton-nucleus bundle located near the center of each atom.

<a href="http://cartridges.esciencelabs.com/TheTypesOfElementsInThePeriodicTable.swf">http://cartridges.esciencelabs.com/TheTypesOfElementsInThePeriodicTable.swf</a>
Chemical Bonding Fundamentals 
The configuration of electrons associated with an atom determines the chemical properties of that atom. Hav-ing a basic understanding of electron configuration aids in the overall comprehension of how atoms inter-act. As mentioned above, electrons are found in orbits that surround the nucleus. There are specific orbits (or "shells") that contain electrons. These shells get filled from the innermost (closest to the nucleus) to the outer-most shell. An atom is most stable (or, unreactive) when the outer shell is filled. Some atoms, such as helium, have a filled outer shell. Because of this, those atoms are not reactive. Most atoms do not have filled outer shells. In order to fill their outer shell, atoms can either gain or lose electrons to other atoms, or they can share electrons with other atoms.   
Elements 
Elements are pure substances that are made of only one type of atom. For example, gold is only made up of gold atoms. There are over 100 known elements, each with different chemical and physical properties. Inter-estingly, the number of naturally occurring elements is unclear as elements continue to be developed and/or detected in laboratories. The periodic table has been used to categorize elements.

Chemical Bonding Fundamentals 
The periodic table contains useful information for performing chemistry. It is organized similarly to a typical data table, and contains individual cells (compartmentalized squares) that are arranged logically in rows and columns according to specific trends. Each cell contains information about a particular element. In the middle of the cell is a one or two letter abbreviation for a particular element called a chemical symbol. For example, Au is the symbol for gold and Na is the symbol for sodium. Above an element's symbol is the atomic num-ber, which is the number of protons that exist in an atom of that element. Each element has its own unique number of protons. For example, gold atoms have 79 protons while all sodium atoms have 11 protons. The number of electrons is normally equal to the number of protons. Therefore, the number of electrons in a gold atom is 79 and the number of electrons in sodium atoms is 11.   As you go across a row (called a period) moving left to right in the periodic table, you will find that the atomic number of the elements increases by one. This means the number of protons in the elements increases by one. The addition of that single proton changes the properties of the atom. On the other hand, when moving down a column (called a group) of the periodic table you will find that the number of electrons in the outer shell remains the same. This is why the atoms within a group have similar chemical behavior.   
Chemical Bonding 
In nature, most elements are not found alone; atoms of most elements combine to make molecules. A mole-cule is a mixture of two or more atoms in definite proportions. A compound forms atoms from different ele-ments combine. These atoms are held together by chemical bonds, bringing them to a stable state. Keep in mind that a stable state is accomplished by the filling of the atoms' outermost shell. Electrons involved with the chemical bonds between atoms are called valence electrons.   
Ionic Bonding 
The two most common bonds are covalent bonds and ionic bonds. Ionic bonds form when an atom or mole-cule carries an electrical charge, which attracts an at-om or molecule of the opposite charge. This electrical charge is created when an atom gains or loses elec-trons in an attempt to fill its outer shell. The resulting ions  have opposite charges and attract one another via electrostatic attractions.   Ionic compounds are formed when anions (negatively charged chemicals) and cations (positively charged chemicals) bind together with ionic bonds (electrostatic attraction). Sodium chloride, NaCl (table 
Figure 3: 
In order to undergo ionic bonding, an elec-
tron must transfer between the Na and Cl atoms. This gives the atoms opposing positive and negative charges, resulting in electrostatic attraction.

Covalent Bonding 
Covalent bonds form when two atoms share valence elec-trons. These electrons can be either shared equally or un-equally between atoms. When electrons in a covalent bond are share equally, the resulting molecule is non-polar. There is not overall charge associated with that molecule. Unequal sharing results in a polar molecule. There exists a positive and negative "pole" or area within polar mole-cules. Fats are typically non-polar while water is a polar molecule. Polar molecules can readily interact with other polar molecules. The positive area of one polar molecule and the negative area of another polar molecule attract each other in an electrostatic manner. What happens when oil is added to water? Do they interact? Polar and non-polar molecules do not, in fact, interact.   
Physical Properties of Bonds 
Ionic and covalent bonds have very different physical properties. For example, ionic compounds have higher melting and boiling points. Ionic compounds also tend to be electrolytes. This means that they contain free ions which make them electrically conductive.   We can use the knowledge that we have of valence electrons and the periodic table to predict which atoms will make ionic bonds, and which will make covalent bonds. Elements on the left side of the periodic table in columns 1A and 2A are electron donors. These atoms form ionic bonds with atoms from the right side of the chart. Compounds that are made up of two or more atoms from the right side of the chart form covalent bonds with each other. These atoms only share electrons. An important exception the "right-hand, left-hand" guide-line of bonding is hydrogen. Hydrogen only has one valence electron, and it will always share its electron to form covalent bonds.

molecules. The negative region is focused near the oxygen molecule, while the positive region is focused near the hydrogen molecules.

Chemical Bonding Fundamentals 
Acids and Bases 
Acids and bases are two important classes of compounds. They have physical and chemical differences that can be observed and tested. An acid is a compound that ionizes (produces ions) in water and releases hydrogen ions (H
+
). Bases tend to dissociate in water 
to produce hydroxide ions (OH
-
). The acidity or alkalinity (how basic 
something is) of a compound can be measured on a scale called pH. pH is a measure of the "power of hydrogen", or potential hydro-gen. A solution that contains a lot of hydrogen ions is considered to be very acidic. In contrast, a solution that contains few hydrogen ions is considered to be very basic. Typical pH values range from 1 - 14. pH 1 is highly acidic, pH 14 is highly basic, and pH 7 is neutral.   Hydrogen chloride (HCl) is an example of a strong acid. Each HCl molecule ionizes in water to form one hy-drogen ion (H
+
) and one chloride ion (Cl
-
). Conversely, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is a strong base and ionizes 
in water to form one sodium ion (Na
+
) and one hydroxide ion (OH
-
).

Experiment 1: Paper Chromatography 
Chromatography is routinely used to separate components of a mixture. In this experiment, you will perform a paper chromatography procedure. The objective for this experiment is to determine the best solvent (ionic, polar covalent or non-polar covalent) for the dyes found in candy-coated chocolate pieces. The chromatog-raphy paper acts as the stationary phase for the  procedure, and a variety of mobile phases (solvents) will be tested. Multiple tests with different eluting solvents must be run to determine the best eluting solvent to separate the food dyes. Some of the factors you will investigate include polarity and electrical charge (ionic characteristics).  
 
Chromatography is based on two phases: the mobile phase and the stationary phase. The mobile phase is the phase which moves up the chromatography paper. This is also referred to as  the eluting solvent, which the mixture of analytes is placed in.   The stationary phase is the material held in place for the chromatography procedure. Think of the mobile phase as a moving stream and the stationary phase as the stream bed. If you were to toss in a leaf, a stick, and a large rock, what would happen? Each different component would travel at different rates along the stationary phase, using the mobile phase as a vehicle. Many properties affect the affinity of a substance for the mobile or stationary phase, including polarity, solubility, particle size and electrical charge. Chemists can use their knowledge of these properties to separate a mixture effectively.

Chemical Bonding Fundamentals 
Procedure 
1.  Gather three 50 mL beakers, one for each color candy you will test.  
2.  Place two M&amp;Ms&#174; candies of one color into a beaker.  
3.  Repeat for each color of the candy you will test. You should have two green candies in one beaker, two 
red candies in a second beaker, and two blue candies in the third beaker. 
Preparation of the Analyte 
4.  Use a pipette and the 10 mL graduated cylinder to add one mL of 70% isopropyl alcohol to each beaker.  
5.  Stir gently with a stir rod until the candy's white undercoating appears. Remove the candies. Be sure to 
rinse the stir rod every time you insert it into a new beaker. 
6.  Allow the solutions to sit and concentrate while stationary phase is prepared.  
Preparation of Stationary Phase 
7.  Obtain a piece of chromatography paper that is approximately 5.5 cm wide and 9.0 cm long.  
8.  Using a pencil, mark the paper according to the sample provided in Figure 7 at the end of the procedure. 
9.  Using a capillary tube, place small spots of the analyte equally spaced along the marked line. Since 
there are three colors to be tested, there will be three spots on the line (use one capillary tube per color; 
save the tubes for the additional trials). 
Note: 
Capillary tubes are extremely thin tubes. They are useful when working with very small 
amounts of a sample, and collect liquid samples through capillary action. To use the capillary tube, 
simply place the open end of the tube in the sample. The liquid molecules will be drawn into the tube 
and stick to the inner walls. Figure 6 provides a references for this process.

Capillary tubes use capillary action to pull up liquid.

10. Allow the spot to dry, and re-spot the analyte in the exact same area as done in Step 9. Repeat this pro-
cess at least five times, or until the colored dots appear distinct on the paper. 
11. Pour the deionized water (your eluting solvent) into the 600 mL beaker until it has reached a height of ap-
proximately 0.5 cm. This will take approximately 20 - 30 mL. 
12. Place the paper (line-side down) into the 600 mL beaker with the eluting solvent for 3 - 5 minutes. Your ini-
tial line should be above the solvent. When complete, the original spots near the bottom of the paper 
should be dissolved (as the colors traveled up the solvent front). 
13. Mark the edge of the solvent front (the edge of the mobile phase) and the location of the analytes with a 
pencil (see Figure 7 for reference). Record your data and any additional observations in Table 1.  
Note: 
Some M&amp;Ms&#174; colors may have more than one spot. The distance travelled by each spot should 
be measured and recorded.  
14. Repeat the procedure five more times, incorporating one of the remaining eluting solvents (0.5% NaCl, 
0.2% NaCl, 70% isopropyl alcohol, and the two solvents that you create) each time.

Experiment 2: Slime Time 
Although you may not realize it, the inks which are used in writing utensils are chemical solutions which in-clude different molecules. Some inks are polar, while others are non-polar. A polar solvent will attract polar inks, while a non-polar solvent will attract non-polar inks. In this experiment, you will use inks to identify slime and silly putty as polar or non-polar. You will also use paper chromatography to verify the inks are correctly identified as polar or non-polar. 
Procedure 
Part 1: Making Slime 
1.  Transfer the 0.5 g of guar gum into an empty 250 mL beaker.   
2.  Use the 100 mL graduated cylinder to measure and pour 50.0 mL of distilled water into the 250 mL beak-
er with the guar gum. 
3.  Use the stir rod to thoroughly mix the solution.  
Note: 
It may take a few minutes to fully dissolve the guar gum in the water. 
4.  Use the 10 mL graduated cylinder to measure and pour four mL of the 4% borax solution into the 250 mL 
beaker with the guar gum solution. 
5.  Use the stir rod to stir the solution until it forms a slime. This will take a few minutes. If the solution re-
mains too runny, add an additional one mL of the 4% borax solution. Continue to stir until the solution is 
the right consistency. 
6.  Once you are satisfied with the slime's consistency, use the popsicle stick to carefully transfer it from the

7.  Manipulate the slime in your hands. When you are done, write down observations about how slime pours, 
stretches, breaks, feels, etc. in the Data: Part 1 section at the end of the procedure. 
Caution: 
Slime is slippery and if dropped it can make the work area slick. 
8.  Transfer the slime back into the beaker and wash your hands. 
 
Part 2: Slime and Putty Ink Tests 
1.  On a piece of notebook paper make one, 20 - 25 mm long mark of each of the inks you are testing. Space 
the marks at least one inch apart. Use a pencil to label each mark with the name of the ink source.  
a.  Water soluble inks include those in highlighters and certain pens.  
b.  Water insoluble inks include those in a permanent pen/markers, newsprint, and a Dry Erase 
markers.  
2.  While the inks are drying, select a passage or a picture in the newspaper to test with the slime.  
3.  Break off a small piece that is 3 - 5 cm in diameter of slime. Gently place this piece on top of the newspa-
per print, then carefully pick it up again.  
4.  Observe and record in Table 2 whether or not the ink was picked up onto the slime.  
5.  Break off another small piece of slime. Once the inks from Step 1 have dried, gently place the slime on 
top of the first spot on the notebook paper, then carefully pick it up.  
6.  Repeat Step 5 for each of the inks. Observe and record which inks were picked up (dissolved) by the 
slime in Table 2.  
7.  Repeat Step 6 ink testing two more times for accuracy.  
8.  Before performing ink tests on Silly Putty&#174;
, in the Data: Part 2 section hypothesize which inks the silly put-
ty will pick up.  
9.  Perform ink tests on Silly Putty&#174;
 in the same manner as above. Record your results in Table 2.

Part 3: Chromatography of Ink Samples 
1.  Use a pencil or scissors to poke a small hole in the center 
of a piece of filter paper disk (see Figure 8). 
2.  Use a rule to spot the filter paper with the two soluble ink 
sources, and the two insoluble ink sources used in Part 2
(four total). Each spot should be approximately two cm 
from the center hole, and should be evenly positioned 
around the circumference of the hole.  
3.  Cut the rectangular piece of filter paper in half. Fold the 
paper in half (length-wise) several times to create a  nar-
row wick.   
4.  Insert the wick into the hole of the filter paper disk so that 
it the top of the wick is approximately two cm from the 
disk.  
5.  Fill a 250 mL beaker 
3
/

 full with water (between 100 and 
150 mL of water). 
6.  Set the filter paper disk on top of the beaker so that the bottom of the wick is submerged in the water. 
The disk should extend passed the circumference of the beaker with the spotted side facing up.  
7.  Allow water to travel up the wick until it is approximately one cm from filter paper disk. Remove the filter 
paper set-up from the beaker. 
8.  Observe which inks moved from where they were originally spotted. Record your observations in the Da-
ta: Part 3 section at the end of the procedure.

Introduction 
Microbiology is the study of microorganisms. Mi-croorganisms are organisms that are too small to be seen with the human eye. This is a huge field for such small subjects. There are many times more microorganisms on Earth than all the other organisms put together. It is estimated, for exam-ple, that in the human body alone there are 10 mi-croorganisms for every one human cell. That means that 90% of the cells found in the human body are not human!  There are many other objects besides microorgan-isms, such as biological structures, that cannot be seen with the human eye. What type of objects can you think of that cannot be seen without the aid of some magnification? Biological structures might include a valve found in a vein that prevents blood from moving backwards or the cells that make up a multicellular organism. The fact is that there are an unimaginable number of objects that we cannot see with the naked eye.   
Types of Microscopes 
Microscopes  are used for the visualization of objects too small for us to see. There are many types of micro-scopes that range from low-level magnification (e.g., hand-held magnification lens) to mid-level magnification (e.g., compound light microscopes) to very high-power magnification (e.g., an electron microscope). The type of microscope that is used depends on the application. For example, if you were trying to locate and remove

Introduction to the Microscope 
a small splinter from your finger, a hand-help magnification lens (magnifying glass) would be extremely help-ful. If you wanted to examine the structure of a tiny virus, you would need an electron microscope.  
Magnification 
Magnification  is one characteristic to consider when deciding what type of microscope is needed for a particular application. The other key char-acteristic is the resolving power. The resolving power refers to the ability of a microscope to show detail. Having a device that can greatly magnify an object is helpful only if the magnified object is well defined (not fuzzy). The resolution is largely dependent on the wavelength of light used. Shorter wavelengths produce higher resolutions. Light microscopes use visible light and electron microscopes use a beam of electrons that travel in wavelike patterns. These waves are 100,000 times shorter than visible light waves! Electron microscopy can therefore be used to visualize ex-tremely small structures.   The  compound light microscope is the most commonly used type of microscope. The name compound refers to presence of more than one lens. The use of these microscopes can be traced to the late 1500s. The early compound microscopes could magnify objects up to about 10X. The magnifying power of a compound microscope is usually expressed in di-ameters. For example, a magnification of 10X refers to a magnification which is 10 diameters larger than the original specimen. In the 1600s a Dutch linen merchant, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, greatly improved upon the production of lens and was able to create microscopes that could magnify objects 200X. He observed and recorded many types of microor-ganisms with his microscopes. Because of this, van Leeuwenhoek is frequently referred to as "the Father of Microbiology". Modern day compound light microscopes can typically magnify objects up to 1000X.   A representative compound light microscope is shown in Figure 2. Note the two sets of lenses: 
 
The ocular lenses (close to your eyes) 
 
The objective lenses (close to the "object" on the stage) 
 
Along with a light source, these lenses work together to magnify the object being viewed. In the case of the compound light microscope, the total magnification is equal to the magnification power of the ocular lens mul-tiplied by the magnification power of the objective lens. For example, if the ocular lens magnifies 10X and the objective lens magnifies 10X, the total magnification is 100X.

Did You Know... 
 
Most cells are not visible to the unaided eye, and require a mi-croscope to visualize them. It is difficult to comprehend the size of cells, especially bacteria, be-cause they are so small. Cell siz-es are usually measured in mi-crometers (also called microns). A micron is one millionth the length of a meter. A typical bac-teria (E. coli) is approximately 2 microns in length. In compari-son, an ostrich egg (which is al-so a single cell!) is about 0.12 meters. This means that a bacte-rial cell is 240,000 times smaller than an ostrich egg. This is about the same ratio of an os-trich egg to a 18-wheeled semi-truck!

Introduction to the Microscope 
Microscope Components 
Below is a list of the parts of a compound light microscope. Refer to Figure 2 as you read through this list to familiarize yourself with these parts. 
 
Base: The flat support of the microscope. 
 
Light: Illuminates the object being viewed. This can be either in the form of a light source or a mirror that reflects ambient light onto the image. In the latter case, it is important to be working in an environment with adequate ambient light. 
 
Stage: Supports the slide or other material to be viewed. 
 
Diaphragm: Controls the amount of light allowed on the object. 
 
Stage Clips: Secure the slide in place.

Introduction to the Microscope 
 
Revolving Nosepiece: Rotates the objective lenses of different magnifications and allows one of them to be positioned over the slide. 
 
Arm: Connects the lower base and the upper head of the microscope (also used to carry the mi-croscope). 
 
Head: Supports both the ocular lens and the revolving nosepiece. 
 
Ocular Lens (eyepiece): The lenses on the microscope typically have a magnification of 10X. If your microscope has a pointer, which is used to indicate a specific area of the specimen, it is at-tached here. Monocular Microscopes have a single ocular eyepiece while binocular micro-scopes have two ocular eyepieces. 
 
The Oil Immersion Lens 
An oil immersion lens is normally used to achieve the highest magnification possible with light microscopes. The oil immersion lens is typically the 100X objective lens. A drop of oil is placed at the tip of the lens so that the oil touches the slide and the lens. The oil helps direct the light into the lens. Without the oil, the light scat-ters reducing the resolution. 
 
How to Use a Microscope 
The following steps describe the proper use of a compound light microscope. 
1.  Always carry a microscope with one hand securely around the arm and the other underneath the 
base for support. 
2.  Place the microscope on a table, plug it in, and turn on the light source (or adjust the mirror as 
necessary).     
Note: 
When cleaning a microscope, do not use paper towels or cloths as this will scratch the 
lens. To preserve the microscope, use only lens paper that will not scratch the optics. 
3.  To prevent damage to the lens or slides, always start and end with the scanning power objective 
lens (the shortest one) above the light source.   
4.  Place your slide on the stage and secure it with the stage clips. It is helpful to visually orient the 
slide so the object to be viewed is directly in the middle of the opening in the stage where the light is directed up toward the slide. 
5.  Turn the course adjustment knob to bring the stage all the way up to the scanning power objective 
lens. While looking through the lens, use the course adjustment knob to slowly  lower the stage until the specimen comes into focus. 
Note: 
Adjust the distance between the two oculars until only one object is seen when using 
a binocular microscope. Record this distance and set your microscope to this distance every time you use it. The lenses may be re-adjusted if someone else uses the microscope.

Introduction to the Microscope 
6.  To adjust the light, open or close the diaphragm located over the light source. The specimen 
should not be gray or exceptionally bright when properly illuminated. 
7.  Rotate the revolving nosepiece to the low-power lens (the next longest) when the object is in gen-
eral focus. Switch to the fine adjustment knob to obtain more precise and greater detail after fo-cusing with the course adjustment knob. It may also be necessary to adjust the light, because more light reduces contrast (sharpness). 
8.  Turn the mechanical stage knobs slowly to the right knobs around the base of the microscope (if 
these knobs are present). Note that the image will be moving toward the left. This image inversion is caused by the lenses. 
9.  Slowly rotate the high-power lens into place (the next longest lens) if you need higher magnifica-
tion. This will bring the tip of the lenses very close to the slide. Make sure the objective lens does not touch the slide. 
10. Whenever you use the high-power lens, only use the fine adjustment knob. If the object was 
well focused while viewing with the low-power lens, very little adjustment should be necessary.   
11. If you cannot bring the object into focus, return to the low-power lens, focus the object, and then 
return to the high-power lens.   
12. Move the revolving nosepiece to the scanning objective lens position before removing the slide 
when finished. 
 
Specimen Preparation 
Proper specimen preparation helps produce the best visual-ization possible with any microscope. Glass slides are used to contain the specimen. Live specimens are usually prepared as wet mounts. In wet mount preparation, the specimen is placed on the slide and a much thinner glass cover slip is placed on top of the specimen. Samples are frequently heat-ed to simultaneously kill and fix (secure) the sample to the glass slide. Fixed samples are then stained to enhance the observable contract between the cellular features.  
 
Stains
 
Different types of stains  may be used to color the specimen depending on the type of microbe and the de-sired outcome. For example, if a specific structure is being studied, one might select a dye that stains only that unique structure. Perhaps the most well-known stain is the Gram stain. The Gram stain was developed in 1884 by Hans Christian Gram. Gram staining is often used to categorize bacteria as Gram positive or Gram negative. The Gram stain distinguishes between bacteria with thick cell walls (Gram positive species) from 
Figure 3: 
Gram-negative bacterial population.

Introduction to the Microscope 
those with thin cell walls (Gram negative species). Thick cell walls entrap the crystal violet, resulting in purple colored cells. Thin cell walls do not entrap the crystal violet dye. Instead, the safranin stain is accepted and red colored cells result.  
 
Gram staining employs a simple, four-step technique and two primary chemical dyes: crystal violet and safra-nin. The first step is always to fix the bacterial sample to the slide. Crystal violet is then applied to the sample as the primary dye. Next, iodine is used to stabilize the crystal violet. After this, the sample is rinsed with al-cohol and the secondary stain, safranin, is applied. This relatively simple four step procedure is used exten-sively especially when determining the cause of a bacterial infection. 
 
How to Prepare a Wet Mount Slide 
1.  To make a wet mount for a specimen that is not already in liquid, take a clean slide and place the 
specimen in the center.  
2.  Add one drop of water. 
Note: 
For cells that are transparent, it may be necessary to add a small drop of stain as op-
posed to water. 
3.  Carefully add a coverslip by placing one end down and slowly lowering the other end.   
Note: 
If the coverslip is added too quickly, large air bubbles may become trapped which can 
cause difficulty viewing the slide. If this happens, gently remove the coverslip, add another drop of water and try again. 
4.  Remove excess liquid on the bottom of the slide or around the edges before it is placed on the 
microscope to avoid damage to the lens. Just touch a tissue to the edge of the coverslip to draw away the water (this is an example of capillary action). 
5.  If the specimen is already in liquid, place a drop in the middle of the slide and add the coverslip as 
you did in Step 3.

Introduction 
There are over 100 known elements as noted in the periodic table. Remember that elements  are pure sub-stances that are made of only one type of atom. Interestingly, the number of naturally occurring elements is unclear, and the periodic table continues to develop as elements are detected or synthesized in laborato-ries. More than 90% of all matter is composed of combinations of just four of the approximately 88 naturally occurring elements: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Living organisms, in general, only require about 20 of the natural elements.

The periodic table of elements categorizes all of the known elements.

The Chemistry of Life  
Organic vs. Inorganic Elements
 
Although the term "organic" is frequently used to refer to foods or clothing, in biology and chemistry, the terms organic and inorganic are used to categorize molecules by their origin. All organic  molecules are those with biological origin. In contrast, inorganic  molecules are not derived from living organisms. Organic molecules are typically identified by the presence of carbon - hydrogen bonds. The human body is made up of roughly 27% organic molecules and 73% inorganic molecules. Carbohy-drates (sugars) and proteins are examples of organic molecules (note that both of these types of molecules are produced by living organisms). Carbon dioxide (CO
2
), table salt (NaCl), and water 
(H
2
O) are all examples of inorganic molecules. Notice that carbon 
dioxide (CO
2
) contains carbon but is not an organic molecule.   
 
Macromolecular Bonds 
There are many classes of organic compounds, based on the functional groups they contain. In living organ-isms, the most important organic compounds belong to a classification of molecules called macromolecules. The term macromolecule simply means a large (macro) molecule. Recall that molecules are substances that contain two or more atoms bonded together. Macromolecules are typically formed by covalent bonding be-tween subunits (depending on the molecule type). You may recall that covalent bonds can produce molecules that are either polar or non-polar. When macromolecules are created, they can be polar or non-polar; or, they may simply have polar or non-polar regions. The non-polar regions tend to be located close together. Polar regions can participate in another type of chemical bond called hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonds result from the interactions between positive and negative regions of polar molecules. Although relatively weak bonds, these are extremely important in the maintenance of chemical structures.   
Biomolecules 
The same four types of macromolecules are used by all living organisms for cellular metabolism and reproduction. These common biological macromole-cules are lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and protein. The properties they convey are of great importance to cell function.   Lipids, or fats, have many functions within living organisms including energy storage, membrane structure, and aids in the formation of internal cellular com-ponents. Lipids, for the most part, are non-polar. All genetic material (DNA) in-cludes four nucleic acid subunits referred to as nucleotides. These are ade-
nine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. The double strands found in DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds. Another type of nucleic acid is called RNA. RNA functions in the production of proteins and other cellular processes. Car-
bohydrates are commonly referred to as sugars. This class of organic compounds serves as one of the pri-mary sources of metabolic energy. The carbohydrate monosaccharide subunit most commonly used for ener-gy is glucose. Other useful carbohydrates include maltose, lactose, sucrose, and starch.

The Chemistry of Life  
Proteins are the most abundant macromolecule in living systems. Like lipids, proteins perform a variety of functions. For example, proteins are major components of tendons, ligaments and muscles in the human body. Some of the 20 amino acids subunits found in proteins are non-polar and some are polar.  
Living things require a constant supply of energy. Throughout this manual, you will learn about the reactions that take place inside of organisms. The sum of these reactions is called metabolism, and is a general term used to describe the energy require to keep those reactions occurring.

The Chemistry of Life  
Experiment 1: Testing for Proteins  
The protein molecules in many foods provide the amino acid building blocks required by our own cells to produce new proteins. To determine whether a sample contains protein, a reagent called Biuret solution is used. The chemical state of the copper ions in a Biuret solution causes them to form a chemical complex with the peptide bonds between amino acids (when present), changing the color of the solution. Biuret solu-tion is normally blue. Biuret solution changes to pink when short peptides are present and to violet when pol-ypeptides are present. 
Procedure 
1.  Label five test tubes 1-5. 
2.  Prepare your testing samples as follows: 
a.  Mix one egg white with 25 mL water in a 250 mL beaker to create an albumin solution. Pipette 5

Experiment 2: Exploring Cell Size 
Have you ever wondered why cells don't grow past a certain size? There is a size limit for cells that they can not surpass. Once a cell reaches this limit, it must divide and form two smaller, daughter cells. Why do they do this? You will look at the importance of cell size in this experiment to help you understand. 
Note: 
This experiment requires preparation 24 hours in advance. 
 
Procedure 
Part 1: Agar Preparation  
1.  Remove or loosen the cap on the agar bottle and place it in the microwave. 
2.  Heat the agar using a microwave or by creating a hot water bath. Perform the following steps to accom-
plish this:  
a.  Determine if you can use a microwave (easiest option), or if you need to create a hot water bath to 
heat the agar. If you require a hot water bath, you will need a stovetop and a small pot. If using a 
microwave, obtain a microwave-safe bowl and proceed to Step 2f. 
b.  Use the 100 mL graduated cylinder to measure and pour approximately 200 mL of water into a 
small pot or microwave-safe bowl (you will have to measure this volume in two separate alloca-
tions). 
c.  Place the pot on the stove and turn the heat on to a medium setting.

d.  Carefully monitor the water in the pot until it comes to a soft boil (approximately 100 &#176;C). Use the 
thermometer provided in your lab kit to verify the water temperature. Turn the stove off when the 
water begins to boil. Remove the pot from the heat source. 
CAUTION: 
Be sure to turn the stove off after creating the hot water bath. Monitor the water at 
all times, and never handle a hot pan without appropriate pot holders. 
e.  Place the agar bottle in the hot water to melt the agar. It may help to periodically swirl the bottle to 
determine if the agar has melted. 
f.  If using a microwave, place the agar bottle in the microwave and heat for one minute in 15 second 
increments. Use a pot holder or hand protectors to remove and swirl the bottle on a flat surface 
every 15 seconds. If the solution is not completely liquefied, remove the lid and place the agar 
bottle back into the microwave using 10 second increments. Continue to swirl the bottle at the giv-
en increments  until it is completely liquefied.  
CAUTION: 
Watch the agar for boil-over while in the microwave. Agar solutions can get very 
hot very quickly, so be certain to monitor the bottle at all times. If it begins to boil-over, imme-
diately stop the microwave, and allow the agar to cool down before proceeding.  
3.  After the agar is liquefied, let the solution sit for one minute to cool down. 
4.  Measure 40 mL into the 250 mL beaker. 
5.  Add 10 mL of the bromothymol blue solution to the liquefied agar in the beaker.  
6.  Add two mL sodium bicarbonate solution to the beaker solution. Use the stir rod to mix.  This will tint the 
mixture and create a pH change. 
7.  Pour the solution into the rectangular mold. Cover the mold with plastic wrap. 
8.  Let the mold sit at room temperature for 24 hours to give the agar time to set. 
Note: 
After the 24 hours, the liquid agar should have firmed up to a Jell-O&#174;
-like consistency.  
 
Part 2: Assessing Cell Size 
1.  Check to be sure the agar has solidified. If it has not, let it sit for another 12 hours. 
2.  Invert the rectangular mold, and gently allow the agar block to fall onto the underpad. You may need to 
jiggle the block a little to loosen the agar. 
3.  From this block, safely cut out a 1.0 cm x 1.0 cm x 6.0 cm block.  
Note: 
It is helpful to measure the 6.0 cm side of the block first.

4.  From the remaining agar, safely cut out a 1.0 cm x 1.0 cm x 1.0 cm cube. Set the block aside. 
5.  Then, carefully cut out a 1.0 cm x 1.0 cm x 2.0 cm cube. Set this block with the others. 
6.  Once all three blocks have been cut, dispose of the scraps of remaining agar. Do not dispose of the 
blocks you just cut! 
7.  Use a ruler to calculate the surface area, volume, and surface area to volume ratio for each block. Refer 
to the example calculations provided after the procedure for help. Record the calculations in Table 2. 
8.  Fill the 250 mL beaker with 150 mL of acetic acid (vinegar). Gently place all three blocks into the solution. 
9.  Let the blocks rest in the vinegar for seven minutes. Observe as the blocks begin to change color (from 
blue to clear). Record how long it takes for each block to completely change colors (from blue to clear). 
Note, some of the blocks may not experience a complete color change. This is okay! 
10. After seven minutes, remove the blocks from the acetic acid. Turn on the water in a sink, and flush the 
remaining acetic acid solution down the drain. 
11. Gently blot the blocks dry and then safely cut them in half. For each block, measure the distance the ace-
tic acid diffused into the gelatin cube, as detected by the color change. Do this by measuring from the out-
er edge of the block to the blue rim inside the cube. Record that value in Table 2.

The Chemistry of Life  
Surface Area 
can be calculated with the following equation: Length x Width = Area. To find the surface 
area of a cube, calculate the area of one side and multiply that by the total number of sides.   
Problem:  
If an equilateral cube is structured so that every side is 3 cm. long, what is the total surface area? 
  
Given: 
Length = 3 cm 
Width = 3 cm 
Total Number of Sides = 6 
 
Solution:  
1.  Solve for the area of each individual side: 
 
Length x Width = 3 cm x 3 cm = 9 cm
2
 
2.  Multiply the area of one side by the total number of sides in the shape. 
 
6 sides x 9 cm
2
 = 54 cm
2 
 
Note: If the 3D structure you are measuring does not contain equilateral dimensions, you must determine the surface area of each side and add them up individually. 
9 cm
2 
per side 
Volume 
can be calculated with the following equation: Length x Width x Height = Volume. 
Problem: Suppose you are working with the same cube as above. What is the total volume? 
 
Given: 
Length = 3 cm 
Width = 3 cm 
Height = 3 cm 
 
Solution: 
1.  Plug your variables into the equation to solve for volume: 
 
3 cm x 3 cm x 3 cm = 27 cm
3
 
Note: To determine surface area to volume ratio, divide the surface area by the volume.
